                              Preface

          IN 2001, AT A TIME WHEN TEXTS WERE EXPENSIVE AND VIDEO ON THE WEB
            was a far-off dream, Creative Commons (CC) began as a rejection of the expansion
            of copyright. In 1998, Congress passed an Act that extended the term of
            existing copyrights by twenty years in the United States. This 1998 extension
            was challenged by CC’s founder, Lawrence Lessig, all the way to the Supreme
             Court, but the Court upheld the Act. In reaction to this decision, a small group
             of lawyers, academics, and culture activists got together to try to make it easy,
            simple, and free to share your works on the burgeoning communications platforms
             of the Internet.
               They couldn’t change copyright law, so they hacked it. Our founders created
             a release valve, built on top of the international laws and treaties that govern
            copyright.
                I think it’s fair to say that no one knew just how successful the CC licenses
            would be, or how much we would need them as we entered a world where every
             single person could be not only a creator, but also a creator of high-quality,
            reusable content. The seeds of Creative Commons were planted long before
            social media, before ubiquitous smartphones and broadband access, and before
            user-generated content platforms. But these seeds set down an essential root
             in the open Internet, and offered a powerful tool used by individuals, governments
            , NGOs, and corporations to create, share, and remix content.
               Today, there are more than 1.6 billion CC-licensed works hosted on over 9
            million websites—including some of the most popular sites on the web. The CC
            licenses operate in every country and have been translated into more than 30
            languages by communities in more than 85 countries. They have been used to
             share every type of content, from photos and videos to 3D models and datasets.
                                                                                             - vii -

          - viii - PREFAcE

          The CC license tools are now the global standard for sharing of works for use
         and reuse. From Wikipedia, to open access to research and journals, to open
          education, to open data, these license tools are an essential element of a more
         equitable and accessible knowledge commons.
            Our goal at Creative Commons is to build a vibrant, usable commons of creativity
         and knowledge, powered by collaboration and gratitude. By default,
          copyright applies to all original content, so sharing under a copyright license
          is always a choice. This means we need to help people understand their options,
          and how they can use the CC licensing tools to maximum benefit. To do this, we
          need people all around the world to be experts in using, contributing to, and
          sharing the commons and the open licensing tools that unlock its full potential.
             We know that the best way to help others is to give them the knowledge they
         need to help themselves. And we know that CC’s greatest power is sharing—of
         knowledge, of culture, and of understanding across cultures and communities
          —so for the first time, we literally wrote the book on Creative Commons, and
          we are sharing it with everyone. Creative Commons for Educators and Librarians
          is a publication of the CC Certificate course content. The CC Certificate is about
          investing in people like you: educators, practitioners, creators, open advocates,
          and activists all over the world. You’re the ones who everyday help people make
          the choice to share and unleash their content so that everyone can benefit from
          it. That’s why we created the CC Certificate course, it’s why we’re working with
          our communities to translate the course content and train new leaders to teach
          it in local languages, and it’s why we’ve made all the content openly accessible
         under CC BY—to unlock new uses we haven’t imagined yet.
             We hope this book will help us get a little closer to that goal, and perhaps
          help us to grow the global community of experts, and ultimately our collective
         power, through shared knowledge and culture.

          What Is Creative Commons?
           CREATIVE COMMONS IS A SET OF LEGAL TOOLS, A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION,
            a global network and a movement—all inspired by people’s willingness to share
             their creativity and knowledge, and enabled by a set of open copyright licenses.
               Creative Commons began in response to an outdated global copyright
             legal system. CC licenses are built on copyright and are designed to give more
             options to creators who want to share. Over time, the role and value of Creative
            Commons have expanded. This chapter will introduce you to where Creative
            Commons came from and where it is headed.
                This chapter has three sections:
                1. The Story of Creative Commons
               2. Creative Commons Today 
                3. Additional Resources
        !  Completing the Creative Commons Certificate does not entitle learners to provide
                        legal advice on copyright, fair use/fair dealing, or open licensing. The content

          - 2 - CHAPTER 1

        1.1 | THE STORY OF CREATIVE COMMONS
          To understand how a set of copyright licenses could inspire a global movement,
          you need to know a bit about the origin of Creative Commons (CC).
       LEARNING OUTCOMES
              •  Retell the story of why Creative Commons was founded
              •  Identify the role of copyright law in the creation of Creative Commons

        THE BIG QUESTION: WHY IT MATTERS
         What were the legal and cultural reasons for the founding of Creative Commons
         ? Why has CC grown into a global movement?
           Creative Commons’ founders recognized the mismatch between what technology
         enables and what copyright restricts, and in response they have provided
         an alternative approach for creators who want to share their work with
          others. Today this approach is used by millions of creators around the globe.
        PERSONAL REFLECTION: WHY IT MATTERS TO YOU
         When did you first learn about Creative Commons? Think about how you would
          articulate what CC is to someone who has never heard of it. To fully understand
          the organization, it helps to start with a bit of history.
       Acquiring Essential Knowledge
          The story of Creative Commons begins with copyright. You’ll learn a lot more
          about copyright later in this book, but for now it’s enough to know that copyright
          is an area of law that regulates the way the products of human creativity
          are used—products like books, academic research articles, music, and art.
          Copyright grants a set of exclusive rights to a creator, so that the creator has the
          ability to prevent others from copying and adapting their work for a limited
          time. In other words, copyright law strictly regulates who is allowed to copy
         and share with whom.
             The Internet has given us the opportunity to access, share, and collaborate
          on human creations (all governed by copyright) at an unprecedented scale. But
          the sharing capabilities made possible by digital technology are in tension with
          the sharing restrictions embedded within copyright laws around the world.
            Creative Commons was created to help address the tension between creators
          ’ ability to share digital works globally and copyright regulation. The story
          begins with a particular piece of copyright legislation in the United States. It

            was called the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act (CTEA), and it was
            enacted in 1998. This Act extended the term of copyright protection for every
            work in the United States—even those already published—for an additional 20
             years, so that the copyright term equaled the life of the creator plus 70 years.
            (This move put the U.S. copyright term in line with some other countries,
             though the term in many more countries remains at 50 years after the creator’s
              death to this day.)
               (Fun fact: The CTEA was commonly referred to as the Mickey Mouse Protection
            Act because the extension came just before the original Mickey Mouse
             cartoon, Steamboat Willie, would have fallen into the public domain.)
               Stanford University law professor Lawrence Lessig (figure 1.1) believed that
            this new law was unconstitutional. The term of copyright had been continually
             extended over the years. The end of a copyright term is important—it marks the
           moment when a work moves into the public domain, whereupon everyone can
             use that work for any purpose without permission. This is a critical part of the
            equation in the copyright system. All creativity and knowledge build on what
            came before, and the end of a copyright term ensures that copyrighted works
             eventually move into the public domain and thus join the pool of knowledge and
             creativity from which we can all freely draw to create new works.
               The 1998 law was also hard to align with the purpose of copyright as it is
             written into the U.S. Constitution—to create an incentive for authors to share
            their works by granting them a limited
            monopoly over them. How could
             the law possibly further incentivize
             sharing works that already existed?
               Lessig represented a web publisher
            , Eric Eldred, who had made a
            career of making works available as
            they passed into the public domain.
             Together, they challenged the consti-

          tutionality of the Act. The case, known as Eldred vs. Ashcroft, went all the way to
          the U.S. Supreme Court. Eldred lost, and the Act was upheld.
       Enter Creative Commons
         Inspired by the value of Eldred’s goal of making more creative works freely
          available on the Internet, and in response to a growing community of bloggers
         who were creating, remixing, and sharing content, Lessig and others came up
         with an idea. They created a nonprofit organization called Creative Commons
         and, in 2002, they published the Creative Commons licenses—a set of free,
          public licenses that would allow creators to keep their copyrights while sharing
          their works on more flexible terms than the default “all rights reserved”
         approach. Copyright is automatic, whether you want it or not; the moment an
          original work is fixed in tangible form, it is protected by copyright. And while
          some people want to reserve all of the rights to their works, many others want
          to share their works with the public more freely. The idea behind CC licensing
          was to create an easy way for creators who wanted to share their works in ways
          that were consistent with copyright law.
            From the start, Creative Commons licenses were intended to be used by creators
          all over the world. The CC founders were initially motivated by a piece
         of U.S. copyright legislation, but similar copyright laws all over the world
          restricted how our shared culture and collective knowledge could be used, even
         while digital technologies and the Internet have opened new ways for people
         to participate in culture and knowledge production. Since Creative Commons
         was founded, much has changed in the way people share and how the Internet
          operates. In many places around the world, the restrictions on using creative
         works have increased. Yet sharing and remix are now the norm online. Think
         about your favorite video mashup, or even the photos your friend posted on
         social media last week. Sometimes these types of sharing and remix happen in
          violation of copyright law, and sometimes they happen within social media networks
          that don’t allow those works to be shared on other parts of the web.

                    Watch the short video A Shared Culture by Jesse Dylan to get a
                    sense for the vision behind Creative Commons. https://creative

              FIGURE 1.2 Growth in the number of Creative Commons-licensed works worldwide

               In domains like textbook publishing, academic research, documentary filmmaking
             , and many other fields, restrictive copyright rules continue to inhibit
             the creation, access, and remix of works. CC tools are helping to solve this problem.
             In 2017, CC licenses were used by more than 1.4 billion works online across
             9 million websites (figure 1.2); since 2017, the number of CC-licensed works has
             increased to over 1.6 billion. The grand experiment that started more than fifteen
            years ago has been a success, sometimes in ways that were unimagined
             by CC’s founders. (For more information, see the “State of the Commons” at the
            Creative Commons website: https://stateof.creativecommons.org.) While other
            custom open copyright licenses have been developed in the past, we recommend
             using Creative Commons licenses because they are up-to-date, free to use,
            and have been broadly adopted by governments, institutions, and individuals
             as the global standard for open copyright licenses.
               In the next section, you’ll learn more about what Creative Commons looks
            like today—the licenses, the organization, and the movement.
         Final Remarks
            Technology now makes it possible for online content to be consumed by millions
             of people at once, and it can be copied, shared, and remixed with speed and

          ease. But copyright law places limits on our ability to take advantage of these
          possibilities. Creative Commons was founded to help us realize the full potential
          of the Internet.
        1.2 | CREATIVE COMMONS TODAY
          As a set of legal tools, a nonprofit organization, and a global network and movement
          , Creative Commons has evolved in many ways over the course of its history.
       LEARNING OUTCOMES
              •  Diff  erentiate between Creative Commons as a set of licenses, a movement,
               and a nonprofit organization
              •  Explain the role of the CC Global Network
              •  Describe the basic areas of work for Creative Commons as a nonprofit
              organization
        THE BIG QUESTION: WHY IT MATTERS
         Now we know why Creative Commons was started. But what is Creative Commons
         today?
            Today CC licenses are prevalent across the web and are used by creators
         around the world for every type of content you can imagine. The open movement
          , which extends beyond just CC licenses, is a global force of people committed
          to the idea that the world is better when we share and work together. Creative
          Commons is the nonprofit organization that stewards the CC licenses and
         helps support the open movement.
        PERSONAL REFLECTION: WHY IT MATTERS TO YOU
         When you think about Creative Commons, do you think about its licenses? Or
          about activists seeking copyright reform? A useful tool for sharing? Symbols in
          circles? Something else?

                     In addition to giving creators more choices for how to share their
                     work, CC legal tools serve important policy goals in fields like
                    scholarly publishing and education. Watch the brief video Why
                    Open Education Matters to get a sense of the opportunities that
         CC licenses create for education. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJWbVt

               Are you involved with Creative Commons as a creator, a reuser, or an advocate
             ? Would you like to be one of these?
         Acquiring Essential Knowledge
             Today, the CC licenses and public domain tools are used on more than 1.6 billion
            works, from songs to YouTube videos to scientific research. The licenses have
            helped a global movement come together around openness, collaboration, and
            shared human creativity. Creative Commons, the nonprofit organization, was
             once housed within the basement of the Stanford Law School, but now has a staff
             working around the world on a host of different projects in various domains.
               We’ll take these different aspects of Creative Commons—the legal tools, the
            movement, and the organization—and look at each in turn.
          CC LICENSES
            CC licenses are legal tools that function as an alternative for creators who
            choose to share their works with the public under more permissive terms than
            the default “all rights reserved” approach under copyright. These legal tools
             are integrated into user-generated content platforms like YouTube, Flickr, and
             Jamendo, and they are used by nonprofit open projects like Wikipedia and Open-
            Stax. They are also used by formal institutions like the Metropolitan Museum
             of Art and Europeana, and by millions of individual creators.
                Collectively, the CC legal tools help create a global commons of diverse types
             of content that is freely available for anyone to use. CC licenses may additionally
            serve a non-copyright function. In communities of shared practices, the
             licenses act to signal a set of values and a different way of operating.
               For some users, this means looking back to the economic model of the commons.
            As the economist David Bollier describes it, “a commons arises whenever
            a given community decides it wishes to manage a resource in a collective manner
             , with special regard for equitable access, use and sustainability.”1 Wikipedia
            is a good example of a commons-based community around CC-licensed content.

                       For a creative take on Creative Commons and copyright, listen 
                      to this song by Jonathan “Song-A-Day” Mann about his choice to
                       use CC licenses for his music in Won’t Lock It Down. https://www 
                       .youtube.com/watch?v=NUGP-oW4_ZE | CC BY 3.0

          - 8 - CHAPTER 1

             For others, the CC legal tools and their icons express an affinity for a set of
         core values. CC icons have become ubiquitous symbols for sharing, openness,
          and human collaboration. The CC logo and icons are now part of the permanent
          design collection at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.
            While there is no single motivation for using CC licenses, there is a basic
          sense that CC licensing is rooted in a fundamental belief that knowledge and creativity
          are the building blocks of our culture rather than simple commodities
          from which to extract market value. The licenses reflect a belief that everyone
          has something to contribute, and that no one can own our shared culture. Fundamentally
          , the licenses reflect a belief in the promise and benefits of sharing.
       THE MOVEMENT
         Since 2001, a global coalition of people has formed around Creative Commons
        and open licensing.2 This includes activists working on copyright reform
         around the globe; policy-makers advancing policies that mandate open access
          to publicly funded educational resources, research, and data; and creators who
          share a core set of values. In fact, most of the people and institutions that are
         part of the CC movement are not formally connected to Creative Commons.
            Creative Commons has a formal CC Global Network,3 which includes lawyers,
          activists, scholars, artists, and more, all working on a wide range of projects and
          issues connected to sharing and collaboration. But the CC Global Network is just
         one player in the larger open movement, which includes Wikipedians, Mozillians
          , open access advocates, and many more.
            Open source software is cited as the first domain where networked open
          sharing produced a tangible benefit as a movement that went much further than
         technology. The Conversation website’s Explainer summarizes other movements
         (http://theconversation.com/explainer-what-is-the-open-movement-10308)
         adds other examples, such as Open Innovation in the corporate world, Open
        Data (see the Open Data Commons at https://opendatacommons.org), and
         Crowdsourcing. There is also the Open Access movement, which aims to make
         research widely available; the Open Science movement; and the growing movement
         around Open Educational Resources.
       CREATIVE COMMONS: THE ORGANIZATION
          Creative Commons is a small nonprofit organization that stewards the CC legal
         tools and helps power the open movement. Creative Commons is a distributed
          organization, with CC staff and contractors working around the world.

              In 2016, Creative Commons embarked on a new organizational strategy
            based on building and sustaining a vibrant, usable commons, powered by collaboration
            and gratitude.4 This is a shift from focusing only on the number of
             works out there under CC licenses and available for reuse, to a new emphasis on
            the connections and collaborations which happen around that content.
              Guided by that strategy, Creative Commons’ organizational work loosely
             falls into two main buckets:
                  •  Licenses, tools, and technology: The CC licenses and public domain tools
                 are the core legal tools designed and stewarded by Creative Commons.
                  While our licenses have been rigorously vetted by legal experts around
                   the globe, our work is still not done. We are actively working on technical
                   infrastructure designed to make it easier to find and use all the content in
                  the digital commons. We are also thinking about ways to better adapt all
                  of Creative Commons’ legal and technical tools for today’s web.
                  •  Supporting the movement: Creative Commons works to help people within
                 open movements collaborate on projects and work toward similar goals.
                 Through CC’s multiple programs, we work directly with our global community
                 —across education, culture, science, copyright reform, government
                 policy, and other sectors—to help train and empower open advocates
                  around the world.
         Final Remarks
            Creative Commons has grown from its home in a law school basement into a
            global organization with a wide reach and a well-known name associated with
             a core set of shared values. It is, at one and the same time, a set of licenses, a
            movement, and a nonprofit organization. We hope this chapter has helped give
            you a sense of what the organization does and, even more importantly, how you
             can join us in our work.

                      Copyright Law
           CREATIVE COMMONS LICENSES DO NOT REPLACE COPYRIGHT. THEY ARE BUILT
             on top of it. The default of “all rights reserved” copyright means that all rights
            to copy and adapt a work are reserved by the author or creator (with some
             important exceptions that you will learn about shortly). By contrast, Creative
            Commons licenses adopt a “some rights reserved” approach, enabling authors
             or creators to free up their works for reuse by the public under certain conditions.
            To understand how Creative Commons licenses work, it is important that
            you have a basic understanding of copyright.
                This chapter has five sections:
                 1. Copyright Basics
                2. Global Aspects of Copyright
                3. The Public Domain
                4. Exceptions and Limitations of Copyright
                5. Additional Resources
              This chapter is important because Creative Commons licenses and public
            domain tools depend on copyright in order to work. While some aspects of
            copyright law have been harmonized around the world, the laws of copyright
            generally vary—sometimes dramatically—from country to country. The information
             contained in this chapter is not intended to be exhaustive or to cover all
             aspects of the complex laws of copyright around the world, or even every aspect
             of copyright that may impact how the CC licenses operate in a particular situ-

         important for an understanding of how Creative Commons licenses operate.
        2.1 | COPYRIGHT BASICS
          Is copyright confusing to you? Let’s get some clarity by understanding its history
         and purpose.
        THE BIG QUESTION: WHY IT MATTERS
         Why do we have laws that restrict the copying and sharing of creative work?
          (Note: A “creative work” can be anything that is an original work. These can
          range from novels, poems, and plays to movies, TV shows, and videos; to songs
          and other musical compositions; to paintings, drawings, and sculptures; to all
         sorts of books, articles, and essays; computer programs; cartoons and comic
          books; and even the drawings our children make and our own jottings on a napkin.
          Anything we write, film, or record is a “creative work” as long as it is an
          original product and is fixed in a tangible form or medium.) And how do laws
          that restrict the copying of creative work function in the context of the Internet,
         where nearly everything we do involves making a copy?
            Copyright law is an important area of law, one that reaches into nearly
          every facet of our lives, whether we know it or not. Aspects of our lives that in
         some instances are not regulated by copyright—like reading a physical book—
         become regulated by copyright when technology is used to share the same book
          by posting it to the Internet. Because almost everything we do online involves
          making a copy, copyright has become a regular feature in our lives.
       LEARNING OUTCOMES
              •  Trace the basic history of copyright
              •  Explain the purpose of copyright
              •  Explain how copyright is automatic
              •  Explain general copyright terms

        PERSONAL REFLECTION: WHY IT MATTERS TO YOU
          Think back to a time when you invested significant effort in a creative project.
          What was your motivation for doing so? Did you know at the time that you were
          creating a work which is very likely protected by copyright, which restricts
          most reuses of that work by others without your permission? Did knowing that,
          or would knowing that, have made a difference to you? If so, why?

         Acquiring Essential Knowledge
             You might not realize it, but copyright law is as integral to your daily life as
             local traffic laws. Copyright law is the area of law that limits how others may
            use the original works of authors (or creators, as we often call them)—works
             spanning the spectrum from novels and operas, to cat videos, to scribbles on a
           napkin.
              Although copyright laws vary from country to country, there are certain
            commonalities among these laws globally. This is largely due to international
             treaties. These treaties are explained in detail in section 2.2 “Global Aspects of
            Copyright.”
              There are some important fundamentals you need to be aware of regarding
             what is copyrightable, as well as who controls the rights and can grant permission
            to reuse a copyrighted work.
                 1. Copyright grants a set of exclusive rights to creators, which means that
                   no one else can copy, distribute, perform, adapt, or otherwise use their
                    work in violation of those exclusive rights. This gives creators the means
                   to control the use of their works by others, thereby incentivizing them
                    to create new works in the first place. The person who controls the rights,
                  however, may not always be the author. It is important to understand
                   who controls the exclusive rights granted by copyright in order to understand
                   who has authority to grant permissions to others to reuse the work
                    (e.g., by adding a CC license to the work). For example:
                       •  Work created in the course of your employment may be subject to
                        differing degrees of employer ownership based on your jurisdiction.
                       Australia, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States adhere
                       to some form of a doctrine commonly known as “work for hire.” This
                        doctrine generally provides that if you have created a copyrightable
                      work within the scope of your employment, the employer is the
                        owner of, and controls the economic rights in the copyrighted work,
                       even though you are the author and may retain your moral rights.
                       •  Independent contractors may or may not own and control copyright
                        in the works they create in that capacity—this determination almost
                      always depends on the terms of the contract between you and the
                      organization that engaged you to perform the work, even though
                       you are the author and may have moral rights.
                       •  Teachers, university faculty, and learners may or may not own and
                        control copyright in the works they create in those capacities—that

          - 16 - CHAPTER 2

                     determination will depend on certain laws (such as work for hire in
                    some instances) and on the terms of the employment or contractor
                    agreement, university or school policies, and terms of enrollment
                     at the particular institution, even though they are the creators and
                    may have moral rights.
                    •  If you have co-created an original work that is subject to copyright,
                    you may be a joint owner, not an exclusive owner, of the rights
                   granted by copyright law. Joint ownership generally allows all
                     owners to exercise the exclusive rights granted by law, but requires
                    the owners to be accountable to one another for certain uses they
                     make of their joint work.
                    •  Ownership and control of the rights afforded by copyright laws
                    are complicated. For more information, please see the “Additional
                      Resources” section at the end of this chapter.
             2. Copyright does not protect facts or ideas themselves, only the expression
                of those facts or ideas. This may sound simple, but unfortunately it is
                not. The difference between an idea and the expression of that idea can
                be tricky, but it’s also extremely important to understand. While copyright
                 law gives creators control over the expression of an idea, it does not
                 allow the copyright holder to own or exclusively control the idea itself.
              3. As a general rule, copyright is automatic the moment a work is fixed in a
                tangible medium. For example, you have a copyright as soon as you type
                the first stanza of your poem or record a song in most countries. Registering
                your copyright with a local copyright
                authority allows you to officially record your
                authorship, and in some countries this may be     !  NOTE The combi-

                 generally speaking, you do not have to register

          A SIMPLE HISTORY OF COPYRIGHT
            Arguably, the world’s most important early copyright law was enacted in 1710
             in England: the Statute of Anne, “An act for the encouragement of learning, by
             vesting the copies of printed books in the authors or purchasers of such copies,
            during the times therein mentioned.”1 This law gave book publishers fourteen
             years of legal protection from the copying of their books by others.
               Since then, the scope of the exclusive rights granted under copyright has
            expanded. Today, copyright law extends far beyond books to cover nearly anything
             with even a fragment of creativity or originality created by humans.
               Additionally, the duration of the exclusive rights has also expanded. Today,
             in many parts of the world, the term of copyright granted an individual creator
             is the life of the creator plus an additional fifty years. See the “Worldwide Map
             of Copyright Term Length” (figure 2.3) in section 2.2 “Global Aspects of Copyright”
            (below) for more details about the duration of copyright and its variances
            worldwide.
               And finally, since the Statute of Anne, copyright treaties have been signed
            by many countries. The result is that copyright laws have been harmonized to
            some degree around the world. You will learn more about the most important
             treaties and how copyright laws work around the world in section 2.2.
          THE PURPOSE OF COPYRIGHT
            There are two primary rationales for copyright law, though rationales do vary
             among legal traditions. The two rationales are:
                  •  Utilitarian: Under this rationale, copyright is designed to provide an
                  incentive to creators. The aim is to encourage the creation of new works.
                  •  Author’s rights: Under this rationale, copyright is primarily intended
                  to ensure attribution for authors and preserve the integrity of creative
                 works. The aim is to recognize and protect the deep connection
                 that authors have with their creative works. (You can learn more about
                  author’s rights in the “Additional Resources” section at the end of this
                  chapter.)
                While different legal systems identify more strongly with one or the other of
              these rationales, or have other justifications particular to their legal traditions,
            many copyright systems are influenced by and draw from both rationales (due,
             in large part, to historical reasons that are outside the scope of this material).

          - 18 - CHAPTER 2

         Do one or both of these justifications resonate with you? What other reasons
          do you believe support or don’t support the granting of exclusive rights to the
          creators of original works?
            Drawing on the author’s rights tradition, most countries also have moral
          rights that protect, sometimes indefinitely, the bond between authors and their
          creative output. Moral rights are distinct from the rights granted to copyright
          holders to restrict others from economically exploiting their works, but they
          are closely connected.
            The two most common types of moral rights are the right to be recognized as
          the author of the work (known traditionally as the “right of paternity”) and the
          right to protect the work’s integrity (generally, the right to object to distortion of
          or the introduction of undesired changes to the work).
             Not all countries have moral rights, but in some parts of the world they are
          considered so integral that they cannot be licensed away or waived by creators,
          and they last indefinitely.
       HOW COPYRIGHT WORKS: A PRIMER
          Copyright applies to works of original authorship, which means works that are
          unique and not a copy of someone else’s work, and most of the time this requires
          the works’ fixation in a tangible medium (written down, recorded, saved to your
          computer, etc.).
             Copyright law establishes the basic terms of use that apply automatically to
          these original works. These terms give the creator or owner of copyright certain
          exclusive rights, while also recognizing that users have certain rights to
          use these works without the need for a license or permission.
         What’s copyrightable?
          In countries that have signed on to the major copyright treaties described in
          more detail in section 2.2, copyright exists in the following general categories
          of works, though sometimes special rules apply on a country-by-country basis.
         A specific country’s copyright laws almost always further specify different

            types of works within each category. Can you think of a type of work within
            each category?
                  •  Literary, artistic, musical, and dramatic works
                  •  Translations, adaptations, arrangements, and alterations of literary,
                  artistic, and musical works
                  •  Collections of literary and artistic works2
                  •  Additionally, depending on the country, original works of authorship
                  may also include, among others:
                        »» Applied art and industrial designs and models
                        »» Computer software

             What are the exclusive rights granted?
             Creators who have copyright have exclusive rights to control certain uses of
             their works by others, such as the following (note that other rights may exist
            depending on the country):
                  •  to make copies of their works
                  •  to publicly perform and communicate their works to the public, including
                  via broadcast
                  •  to make adaptations and arrangements of their works (Adaptations can
                   include translations.)
             This means that if you own the copyright to a particular book, no one else can
           copy or adapt that book without your permission (with important caveats,
             which we will get to later in section 2.3 “Global Aspects of Copyright”). Keep in
            mind that there is an important difference between being the copyright holder
             of a novel and controlling how a particular authorized copy of the novel is used.
             While the copyright owner owns the exclusive rights to make copies of the novel,
            the person who owns a particular physical copy of that novel can generally do
              what they want with it, such as loan it to a friend or sell it to a used bookstore.
                One of the exclusive rights of copyright is the right to adapt a work. An adaptation
             (or a “derivative work,” as it is sometimes called) is a new work based
            on a preexisting work. In some countries, the term derivative work is used to
             describe changes that include but are not limited to “adaptations” as described
            in the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works,
             which uses both of these terms in different articles. For the purposes of this
            book and for understanding how CC licenses and public domain tools work, the
           terms derivative work and adaptation are interchangeable and denote a work

          - 20 - CHAPTER 2

          that has been created from a preexisting work through changes that can only be
          made with the permission of the copyright holder. It is important to note that
          not all changes to an existing work require permission. Generally, a modification
          rises to the level of an adaptation or derivative when the modified work
          is based on the prior work and manifests sufficient new creativity to be copyrightable
          , such as a translation of a novel from one language to another, or the
          creation of a screenplay based on a novel.
            Copyright owners often grant permission to others to adapt their work.
         Adaptations are entitled to their own copyright, but that protection only
          applies to the new elements that are particular to the adaptation. For example,
          if the author of a poem gives someone permission to make an adaptation, that
         person may rearrange stanzas, add new stanzas, and change some of the wording
          , among other things. Generally, the original author retains all copyright in
          the elements of the poem that remain in the adaptation, and the person adapting
          the poem has a copyright in their new contributions to the adapted poem. Creating
          a derivative work does not eliminate the copyright held by the creator of
          the preexisting work.
          A special note about additional exclusive rights
         There are two other categories of rights that are important to understand
         because the rights are licensed and referenced by Creative Commons licenses
          and public domain tools:
              •  Moral rights: As mentioned above, moral rights are an integral feature of
               many countries’ copyright laws. These rights are recognized in Article
               6bis of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic
               Works—described in more detail in section 2.2—and are integrated in the
               laws of all treaty signatories to some extent. Creative Commons licenses
                and legal tools account for these moral rights, and the reality is that they
               cannot be waived or licensed in many countries, even though other exclusive
                economic rights are waivable or licensable.
              •  Similar and related rights (including rights known in many countries as
                “neighboring rights”): Closely related to copyright are similar and related
               rights. These are rights that relate to copyrighted works and grant additional
               exclusive rights beyond the basic rights granted authors that were
               described above. Some of these rights are governed by international treaties
               , but they also vary country by country. Generally, these rights are

                                                     COpYRiGhT LAw - 21 -

                  designed to give some “copyright-like” rights to those who are not themselves
                   the author but are involved in communicating the work to the public,
                  for example, broadcasters and performers. Some countries like Japan have
                   established these rights as part of copyright itself, while other countries
                   treat these rights separately from, though closely related to, copyright.
                        »» The term Similar Rights is used to describe these similar and
                         related rights in CC licenses and CC0, as you will learn in the next
                         chapter in section 3.2.
                        »» An in-depth discussion of these rights is beyond the scope of this
                         unit. What is important to be aware of is that they exist, and that
                       Creative Commons licenses and public domain tools cover these
                        rights, thereby allowing those who have such rights to use CC tools
                        to give the public permission to use works in ways that would otherwise
                         violate those rights.
             Does the public have any right to use copyrighted works that do not violate the
             exclusive rights of creators?
             All countries that have signed on to major international treaties grant the public
            some rights to use copyrighted works without permission, and without violating
             the exclusive rights given creators. These are generally called “exceptions
            and limitations” to copyright. Many countries itemize the specific exceptions
            and limitations on which the public may rely, while some countries have flexible
             exceptions and limitations such as the concept of “fair use” in the United
            States, “fair dealing” in some Commonwealth countries, and education-specific
            exceptions and limitations in many other parts of the world, including
             the Global South. Exploring these concepts in detail is reserved for section 2.4
            “Exceptions and Limitations of Copyright.” What is important to know is that
            copyright law does not require permission from the creator for every use of
            a copyrighted work—some uses are permitted as a matter of copyright policy,
            which balances the sometimes competing interests of the copyright owner and
             the public.
            What else should I know about copyright?
            As noted at the beginning of this chapter, copyright is complex and varies
             around the world. This chapter serves as a general introduction to its central
             concepts. There are some concepts, such as (1) liability and remedies, (2) licensing
             and transfer, and (3) termination of copyright transfers and licenses, that

          - 22 - CHAPTER 2

          you should be aware of because you are likely to encounter them at some point.
          You will find a comprehensive explanation of these concepts in the “Additional
          Resources” section at the end of this chapter.
        Distinguishing Copyright from Other Types 
        of Intellectual Property
          Intellectual property is the term used for rights—established by law—that
          empower creators to restrict others from using their creative works. Copyright
          is one type of intellectual property, but there are many others. To help understand
          copyright, it is important to have a basic understanding of at least two
          other types of intellectual property rights and the laws that protect those rights.
              •  Trademark law generally protects the public from being confused about
                the source of a good, service, or establishment. The holder of a trademark
                is generally allowed to prevent uses of its trademark by others if the public
               will be confused. Examples of trademarks are the golden arches used
              by McDonald’s and the brand name Coca-Cola. Trademark law helps producers
                of goods and services protect their reputation, and it protects the
               public by giving them a simple way to differentiate between similar products
                and services.
              •  Patent law gives inventors a time-limited monopoly to their inventions—
               things like mousetraps or new mobile phone technology. Patents typically
               give inventors the exclusive right to make, have made, use, have used,
                offer for sale, sell, have sold, or import patentable inventions.
             Other types of intellectual property rights include trade secrets, publicity
          rights, and moral rights, to give just a few examples.
       Final Remarks
          Digital technology has made it easier than ever to copy and reuse works that
          others have created, and it has made it easier than ever to create and share your
          own work. In short, copyright is everywhere. Since nearly every use of a work

            Copyright laws vary from country to country, yet we operate in a world where
            media is global. Over time, there has been an effort to standardize copyright
            laws around the globe.

         LEARNING OUTCOMES
                  •  Learn how the copyright laws of your country may differ from those of
                 other countries
                  •  Identify major international treaties and efforts to harmonize copyright
                 laws around the world
          THE BIG QUESTION: WHY IT MATTERS
            Although copyright laws differ from country to country, the Internet has made
            global distribution and sharing of copyrightable works possible with just the
            click of a button. What does this mean for you, when you share your works on
            the Internet and use works published by others outside your country? What

          - 24 - CHAPTER 2

         law applies to a video taken by someone from India during their travels in
         Kenya and then posted to YouTube? What about when that video is watched or
         downloaded by someone in Canada?
            Copyright law is locally implemented by every country around the world. In
         an effort to minimize complexity, efforts have been undertaken to harmonize
          some of the basic elements of how copyright works across the globe.
        PERSONAL REFLECTION: WHY IT MATTERS TO YOU
         When you publish or reuse something online, have you ever thought about
          what law applies to you? Does it make sense to you that different people should
         have different limits to what they can do with your work based on their geographic
         location? Why or why not?
        Acquiring Essential Knowledge: 
        Introduction to the Global Copyright System
       INTERNATIONAL LAWS
         Every country has its own copyright laws, but over the years there has been
          extensive global harmonization of copyright laws through treaties and multilateral
          and bilateral trade agreements. These treaties and agreements establish
         minimum standards for all participating countries, which then enact or amend
         their own laws in order to conform to the agreed-upon limits. This system
          leaves room for local variations.
            These treaties and agreements are negotiated in various forums: the World
          Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), the World Trade Organization
          (WTO), and in private negotiations between countries.
            One of the most significant international agreements on copyright law is
         the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (the
         “Berne Convention”), concluded in 1886. The Berne Convention has since been
         revised and amended on several occasions. WIPO serves as the administrator
          of the treaty and its revisions and amendments, and is the depository for official
          instruments of accession to and ratification of the treaty. Today, 177 countries
          (as of October 17, 2019) have signed the Berne Convention. This treaty (as
         amended and revised) lays out several fundamental principles upon which all
          the participating countries have agreed. One of these principles is that copyright
          must be granted automatically—that is, there must be no legal formalities 
          required to obtain copyright protection (for example, the national laws of the
          signatories cannot require you to register or pay for your copyright as a con-

            they give to works created within their borders, assuming the other country
             is a signatory. Figure 2.2 is a map showing (in dark gray) the signatories to the
            Berne Convention as of 2012.
               Additionally, the Berne Convention sets minimum standards—default
            rules—for the duration of copyright protection for creative works, though
          some exceptions exist, depending on the subject matter. The Berne Convention
            ’s standards for copyright protection dictate a minimum term of
            the life of the author plus 50 years. Because the Berne Convention sets minimums
        only, several countries have established longer terms of copyright
             for individual creators, such as “life of the author plus 70 years” or “life of
            the author plus 100 years.” You can review the Wikipedia article on “Copyright

            have further harmonized copyright rules around the world.3

       NATIONAL LAWS
         Although an international framework exists because of the Berne Convention
          and other treaties and agreements, copyright law is actually enacted and
         enforced through national laws. Those laws are supported by national copyright
          offices, which in turn support copyright holders, allow for registration,
        and provide interpretative guidance. As mentioned, while there has been
         a major effort to create minimum standards for copyright across the globe,
          countries still have a significant amount of discretion as to how they meet the
          requirements imposed by the various treaties and agreements. This means that
          the details of copyright law still vary quite a bit from country to country.
          Which nation’s law applies to my use of a work restricted by copyright?
         A common question of copyright creators and users of their works is which
          nation’s copyright law applies to a particular use of a particular work. Generally
          , the rule of territoriality applies: national laws are limited in their reach
          to activities taking place within that country. This also means that generally
          speaking, the law of the country where a work is used applies to that particular

             use. If you are distributing a book in a particular country, then the law of the
            country where you are distributing the book generally applies.
                This is true even in the era of the Internet, though it is much harder to apply.
            For example, if you are a Canadian citizen traveling to Germany and using a
           copyrighted work in your PowerPoint presentation, then German copyright
             law normally applies to your use.
               It can be complicated to determine which national law applies in any given
             case. This complexity is one of the benefits of Creative Commons licenses, which
            are designed to be enforceable everywhere.
         Final Remarks
            Even though global copyright treaties and agreements exist, there is no one
             “international copyright law.” Different countries have different standards for
             what is protected by copyright, how long copyright lasts and what it restricts,
             and what penalties apply when it is infringed.
          2.3 | THE PUBLIC DOMAIN
            The “public domain” consists of creative works that are not subject to copyright.
             This is the enormous pool of publicly available material which circulates
            freely, and from which new creative works and knowledge may be built. Figure
             2.4 shows a still from the 1902 French film Le Voyage dans la lune (A Trip to the 
            Moon), which is now in the public domain.

        THE BIG QUESTION: WHY IT MATTERS
          Why is it important that works eventually fall out of copyright? Are there any
          works that do not qualify for copyright protection and may be freely used?
             A critical aspect of copyright law is that the protection it provides does not
          last forever. After a set term, the copyright expires and the work enters the public
          domain for everyone to copy, adapt, and share. Likewise, there are certain
          types of works that fall outside the scope of copyright.
        PERSONAL REFLECTION: WHY IT MATTERS TO YOU
          Have you ever seen ancient Egyptian sculptures in real life? Have you ever listened
         to a Beethoven symphony? Have you ever read Tolstoy’s novel War and
         Peace? These works are in the public domain. What other public domain works
         have you enjoyed in your lifetime? Have you ever created something new using
          a work in the public domain?
       Acquiring Essential Knowledge
          Despite the expansive reach of copyright, there is still a rich (and growing) public
          domain full of works which are free from copyright. Works enter the public
          domain in one of four ways:
               1. The copyright expires.
                  While copyright terms are longer than ever before, they are not in­fi -
                  nite. In most countries, the term of an individual’s copyright expires
                  50 years after her death. In some countries, the term is longer and can
                  be up to 100 years after the author dies. Review the map in figure 2.3
                  (earlier in this chapter) for an overview of copyright terms around 
                  the world.
               2. The work was never entitled to copyright protection.        !  NOTE Moral

                     cannot be copyrighted, such as official texts of a legislative, administrative
                    , and legal nature. Furthermore, in some countries, works
                   created by government employees are excluded from copyright protection
                     and are not eligible for copyright. Facts and ideas are never
                    copyrightable.
                  3. The creator dedicates the work to the public domain before its copyright has
                    expired.
                     In most parts of the world, a creator can decide to forego the protections
                     of copyright and dedicate their work to the public domain. Creative
                    Commons has a legal tool called CC0 (“CC Zero”) Public Domain
                     Dedication that helps authors put their works into the worldwide public
                      domain to the greatest extent possible. You’ll learn more about this
                      tool (and other Creative Commons legal tools) later in this book.
                 4. The copyright holder failed to comply with the formalities required to
                    acquire or maintain their copyright.
                    Today in most countries, there are no formal requirements to acquire
                    or renew copyright protection over a work. This was not always the
                    case, however, and many works have entered the public domain over
                      the years because a creator failed to adhere to these formalities.
          WHAT CAN YOU DO WITH A WORK THAT IS IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN?
            You can do almost anything, but it depends on the scope and duration of copyright
            protection in the particular country where the work is used. Depending
            on the country, for example, a work in the public domain may still be covered
             by moral rights that last beyond the duration of copyright. It’s also possible that
            a work is in the public domain in one country but is still under copyright in
            another country. This means you may not be able to use the work freely where
             copyright still applies.

          - 30 - CHAPTER 2

       AUTHOR CREDIT AND THE PUBLIC DOMAIN
         Even though it may not be legally required in every country, and especially
          in those countries where moral rights do not exist after the term of copyright
          expires, there are many benefits to identifying and giving credit to the original
          creators, even after their work has entered the public domain. Many communities
         have adopted norms, which are accepted standards for crediting the
         authors and the treatment of works in the public domain. Creative Commons
          has created public domain guidelines that can be used by communities to create
          their own norms. You can review the CC guidelines at https://wiki.creativecommons.org
         /wiki/Public_Domain_Guidelines. Can you think of a reason why it
          might be helpful to give credit to an author whose work is in the public domain?
         Can you think of why norms should be encouraged when public domain works
         are reused?
        FINDING WORKS IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN
         With millions of creative works whose copyright has expired—and many more
         added regularly with tools like the CC0 Public Domain Dedication—the public
          domain is a vast treasure trove of content.
            Among the sites that host works in the public domain are Project Gutenberg,
         Public Domain Review, Digital Public Library of America, Wikimedia Commons
          , Internet Archive, Library of Congress, Flickr, and the Rijksmuseum. The
         CC Search tool (https://search.creativecommons.org/) is another way to find
          public domain material. 
            It is not always easy to identify whether a work is in the public domain
          (though there are many resources available to help). As we learned, copyright
         protection is automatic, so the absence of the copyright symbol “©” does not
         mean a work is in the public domain. In addition to its CC0 Public Domain
         Dedication for creators, Creative Commons also has a tool called the Public
      !  NOTE A work that is in the public domain for purposes of copyright law may still
                     be subject to other intellectual property restrictions. For example, a story that
                     is in the public domain may have a trademarked brand on the cover associated
                     with the publisher of the book. Trademark protection is independent of copyright
          protection and may still exist even though the work is in the public domain as a matter of
          copyright. Also, once a creator uses a public domain work to turn it into a new work, the
          creator will have copyright on the portions of their new work that are original to them. As
          an example, the creator of a film adaptation based on a novel in the public domain will have
          copyright protection over the film, but not the underlying novel.

           Domain Mark (https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/
            pdm), which is designed to label works whose copyright has expired everywhere
             in the world, so that reusers can easily identify those works as being in
            the worldwide public domain. As of 2016, CC’s public domain tools were used
            on more than 90 million works.
         Final Remarks
             A healthy public domain is crucial to preserving our cultural heritage, inspiring
            new generations of creators, and increasing human knowledge. Because
            the scope and duration of copyright have grown so much over the years, it can
             be easy to forget that the public domain exists at all. But the public domain is
             a critical part of the bargain of copyright and works in the public domain are
             incredible resources that belong to all of us.
          2.4 | EXCEPTIONS AND LIMITATIONS TO COPYRIGHT
             The limitations and exceptions built into copyright, including “fair use” and
             “fair dealing” in some parts of the world, were designed to ensure that the
             rights of the public were not unduly restricted by copyright.
          THE BIG QUESTION: WHY IT MATTERS
             What would the world look like if copyright had no limits to what it prevented
            you from doing with copyrighted works?
               Imagine resorting to Google’s search engine on your laptop or smartphone
             to settle a disagreement with a friend about some bit of trivia. You type in your
            search query, and Google comes up empty. You then learn that a court has
            required Google to delete its entire web index because it never entered into
            copyright agreements with each individual author of each individual page on
            the web. By indexing a web page and showing the public a snippet of the contents
             in their search results, the court has declared that Google violates the
            copyrights of hundreds of millions of people and can no longer show those
             search results.
               Fortunately, thanks to the exceptions and limitations built into copyright
             laws in much of the world, including the fair use doctrine under U.S. copyright
             law, this hypothetical scenario is unlikely to become reality in most countries.
             This is one of many illustrations that show why it is so important that copyright
             has built-in limitations and exceptions.

       LEARNING OUTCOMES
              •  State what limitations and exceptions to copyright are and why they exist
              •  Name a few common exceptions and limitations to copyright

        PERSONAL REFLECTION: WHY IT MATTERS TO YOU
          Have you ever made a copy of a creative work? Can you recall a time when you
          were studying and you included properly cited quotations in a research paper
          you wrote? Can you think of a way an exception or limitation to copyright has
         benefited you?
       Acquiring Essential Knowledge
         Copyright is not absolute. There are some uses of copyrighted works that do
          not require permission. These uses are limitations on the exclusive rights normally
         granted to copyright holders and are known as “exceptions and limitations”
          to copyright.
             Fair use, fair dealing, and other exceptions and limitations to copyright are
          an extremely important part of copyright design. Some countries afford exceptions
          and limitations to copyright, such as fair dealing, while other countries do
          not offer them at all.4 If your use of another person’s copyrighted work is “fair
          use” or falls within another exception or limitation to copyright, then you are
          not infringing that creator’s copyright.
             When legislators created copyright protections, they realized that allowing
          copyright to restrict all the possible uses of creative works could be highly problematic.
          For example, how could scholars and critics write about plays, books,
         movies, or other artworks without quoting from them? (It would be extremely
          difficult.) And would copyright holders be inclined to provide licenses or other
         permission to people whose reviews of their works might be negative? (Probably
          not.)
             For this and a range of other reasons, certain uses are explicitly carved out
         from copyright to widely different degrees depending on the jurisdiction—
         including uses for the purposes of criticism, commentary, news reporting, teaching
          , scholarship, research, parody, and access for the visually impaired. The use
         of copyrighted works—or portions of those works—for these purposes is not
         an infringement of those works’ copyright when an exception or limitation to
          copyright applies. These uses are known as “fair use” or “fair dealing” in some
          parts of the world.

                The Berne Convention first established the concept of “fair use” by providing
             the following in Article 9, section 2. This is known as the “three-step” test, and
             has been adopted in some form in several other treaties:
                  It shall be a matter for legislation in the countries of the Union to permit the
                  reproduction of such works in certain special cases, provided that such repro-
                  duction does not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work and does not
                  unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the author. (emphasis added)
                For more information about the scope and use of the three-step test, read the
            short primer published by the Electronic Frontier Foundation at https://www 
              .eff.org/files/filenode/three-step_test_fnl.pdf.
              The exceptions and limitations to copyright vary by country. There are
            global discussions around how to harmonize them. A World Intellectual Property
            Organization study (https://www.wipo.int/edocs/mdocs/copyright/en/
             sccr_30/sccr_30_3.pdf ) by Kenneth Crews compares the copyright exceptions
             and limitations for libraries in many countries around the world.
               Generally speaking, there are two main ways in which limitations and exceptions
              are written into copyright law. The first is by listing specific activities that
            are excluded from the reach of copyright. For example, Japanese copyright law
            has a specific exemption allowing classroom broadcasts of copyrighted material.
            This approach has the benefit of providing clarity about precisely what
            uses by the public are allowed and are not considered infringing. However, it
             can also be limiting because anything not specifically on the list of exceptions
            may be deemed restricted by copyright.
                The other approach is to include flexible guidelines about what is allowed in
             the spirit of the three-step test described above. Courts then determine exactly
            what uses are allowed without the permission of the copyright holder. The
            downside to flexible guidelines is that they leave more room for uncertainty.
             This is the approach used in the United States with fair use, although U.S. copyright
            law also has some specific exceptions to copyright written into the law
             as well. In the United States, fair use is determined using a four-factor test,5 in
             which a federal court judge considers (1) the purpose and character of use, (2)
            the nature of the copyrighted work, (3) the amount and substantiality of the
            portion taken from the work, and (4) the effect of the use upon the potential
             market for the copyrighted work. (See the “Additional Resources” section at the
             end of this chapter for a good selection of publications that discuss fair use and
             other exceptions and limitations to copyright.)

          - 34 - CHAPTER 2

            Most countries also have compulsory licensing schemes, which are another
          form of limitation on the exclusive rights of copyright holders. These statutory
         systems make copyrighted content (for example, music) available for particular
          types of reuse without asking permission, but they require payment of specified
          (and non-negotiable) fees to the copyright owners. Compulsory licensing
         schemes permit anyone to make certain uses of copyrighted works so long as
          they pay a fee to the rights holder whose work will be used.
           As an organization and a movement, Creative Commons supports strong
          exceptions and limitations to copyright. But the vision of Creative Commons—
          universal access to research and education and full participation in culture—
         will not be realized through licensing alone. Creative Commons supports a
         copyright system that appropriately balances the rights of creators and the
          rights of users and the general public.
       Final Remarks
         Like the public domain, the exceptions and limitations to copyright are just
          as important as the exclusive rights that copyright grants. Think of them as a
          safety valve for the public in order to be able to utilize copyrighted works for
          particular uses in the public interest. You should educate yourself about the
          exceptions and limitations that apply in your country, so you can take advantage
          of and advocate for these critical user rights.

        LIABILITY AND REMEDIES
          Generally, to establish a claim of copyright infringement, a creator or holder
         of copyright need only show that they have a valid copyright in the work and
         that the defendant copied protected expression from the work. However, the
          intention of the alleged infringer may be relevant in some cases, such as if the
          defendant asserts that an exception or limitation applied to their use or that
         their work was independently created.
            The copyright laws of some countries grant copyright holders statutory
         remedies for infringement. The type and amounts of remedies, including damages
          , are established by law. You should be aware of the existence of statutory

            damages and other remedies permitted by applicable law, including statutory
             provisions that award legal fees in some circumstances.
          LICENSING AND TRANSFER
             Many creators and copyright holders need help to fully exercise their exclusive
             rights or simply give others permission to exercise the rights granted by copyright
             law. Several options exist to do this. Some creators choose to license some
             or all of their rights, either exclusively or nonexclusively. Others choose to sell
             their rights outright and allow others to exercise them in their place, sometimes
            in exchange for royalty payments. There are often formalities associated with
             the sale or licensing of copyrights, including when a copyright license must be
             in writing, depending on the copyright law that applies.
          TERMINATION OF COPYRIGHT TRANSFERS AND LICENSES
            The laws of some countries grant copyright holders the right to terminate
            transfer agreements or licenses even if the transfer agreement or license
            doesn’t allow it. In the United States, for example, copyright law provides
            two mechanisms for doing so, depending on when the transfer agreement or
             license became effective. For more information on these rights and a tool that
             allows creators and copyright holders to figure out if they have those rights, see

                by the Berne Convention. Another manner in which copyright policy is made
                is through bilateral and multilateral trade agreements. As of 2017, there were
                several negotiations underway. These include the Regional Comprehensive
                Economic Partnership (RCEP) and the renegotiation of the North American Free
                Trade Agreement (NAFTA). A major drawback of multilateral trade negotiations
                is that they are typically conducted in secret with little or no participation from

              Anatomy of a CC License
          CREATIVE COMMONS LICENSES GIVE EVERYONE FROM INDIVIDUAL CREATORS
             to large companies and institutions a clear, standardized way to grant permission
            to others to use their creative work. From the reuser’s perspective, the
            presence of a Creative Commons license answers the question, “What can I
             do with this?” and provides the freedom to reuse the work of others, subject to
             clearly defined conditions.
                All CC licenses ensure that creators retain their copyright and get credit for
             their work, while still permitting others to copy and distribute it. Although the
             CC legal tools are designed to be as easy to use as possible, there are still some
             things to learn in order to fully understand their mechanics.
                This chapter has five sections:
                1. License Design and Terminology
                2. License Scope

             Do you “speak CC” yet? This section covers the acronyms, terms, and icons used
             in connection with Creative Commons’ tools, as well as some key things to know
            about how the licenses were designed.

                                                                                             - 39 -

       LEARNING OUTCOMES
              •  Differentiate the meaning of different CC icons
              •  Identify the three layers of CC licenses

        THE BIG QUESTION: WHY IT MATTERS
          Given that most of us are not lawyers, what do we need to know about the legalities
          in order to use CC licenses properly?
             Creative Commons’ legal tools were designed to be as accessible to everyone
          as possible while still being legally robust. CC’s founders made several design
          decisions that make these legal tools relatively easy to use and understand.
        PERSONAL REFLECTION: WHY IT MATTERS TO YOU
          Have you ever come across a CC-licensed Flickr image that you really liked but
          were afraid to use because you weren’t sure of the legal terms and conditions?
         Have you ever been frustrated because you didn’t understand how to decide
          which of the CC legal tools to use for your own work?
       Acquiring Essential Knowledge
          Copyright operates by default under an “all rights reserved” approach. Creative
          Commons licenses function within copyright law, but they utilize a “some rights
          reserved” approach. While there are several different CC license options, all of
          them grant permission to use the works under certain standardized conditions.
         The licenses grant those permissions for as long as the underlying copyright
          lasts or until/unless you violate the license terms. This is what we mean when
          we say CC licenses work on top of copyright, not instead of copyright.
             The CC licenses were designed to be a free, voluntary solution for creators
          who want to grant the public up-front permission to use their works. Although
          the licenses are legally enforceable tools, they were designed in a way that was
          intended to make them accessible to non-lawyers.
             The licenses are built using a three-layer design (figure 3.1).
               1. The legal code is the base layer. This contains the “lawyer-readable” terms
                and conditions that are legally enforceable in court. Take a minute and
              scan through the legal code of CC BY (https://creativecommons.org/
                 licenses/by/4.0/legalcode) to see how it is structured. Can you find where
                the attribution requirements are listed?
              2. The commons deeds are the best-known layer of the licenses. These
               are the web pages that lay out the key license terms in “human-read-

                   able” terms. The deeds are not legally
                   enforceable but instead summarize the
                   legal code. Take some time to explore
                   the deeds for CC BY (https://creative 
                 commons.org/licenses/by/4.0) and 
               CC BY-NC-ND (https://creativecommons 
                   .org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/) and identify
                   how they differ. Can you find the
                    links to the legal code from each deed?
                 3. The final layer of the license design
                   recognizes that software plays a critical
                    role in the creation, copying, discovery
                   , and distribution of works. In
                   order to make it easy for websites and         FIGURE 3.1 The three layers 
                                                                                 of a CC license
                web services to know when a work
                   is available under a Creative Commons license, we provide a “machinereadable”
                    version of the license (see figure 3.2)—this is a summary of the
                   key freedoms granted and obligations imposed, and is written into a format
                   that applications, search engines, and other kinds of technology can
                  understand. We developed a standardized way to describe licenses that
                  software can understand called CC Rights Expression Language (CC REL)
                   to accomplish this. When this metadata is attached to CC-licensed works,
                  someone searching for a CC-licensed work using a search engine (e.g.,
                  Google Advanced Search) can more easily discover CC-licensed works.

        CC LICENSE BASICS
         All Creative Commons licenses have many important features in common. At a
          minimum, every license helps creators (we call them “licensors” when they use
          CC tools) retain copyright while allowing others to copy and distribute their
          work. Every CC license also ensures that licensors get credit for their work. CC
          licenses work around the world and last as long as the applicable copyright lasts
          (because they are built on copyright) and as long as the user complies with the
          license. These common features serve as the baseline, on top of which licensors
         can choose to grant additional permissions when deciding how they want their
          work to be used.
           !   NOTE Throughout all of the CC Certificate content, please assume that all descriptions
                of the licenses refer to the most recent version of the CC license suite, Version 4.0,
          unless otherwise indicated. You will learn more about the different versions in section 3.3
          “License Types.”

       CHOICES FOR THE LICENSOR
         All Creative Commons licenses are structured to give the user permission to
          make a wide range of uses as long as the user complies with the conditions in the
          license. The basic condition in all of the licenses is that the user provides credit
          to the licensor and certain other information, such as where the original work
         may be found.
             A CC licensor makes a few simple decisions on the path to choosing a license:
          first, do I want to allow commercial use of my work; and second, do I want to
          allow derivative works (also known as adaptations)? We’ll address adaptations
          in greater detail within chapter 4.
            If a licensor decides to allow derivative works, they may also choose to
         require that anyone who uses the work—we call them “licensees”—make their
          new work available under the same license terms. This is what is meant by “ShareAlike
          ,” and it is one of the mechanisms that has helped the digital commons of
          CC-licensed content grow over time. ShareAlike is inspired by the GNU General
          Public License, which is used by many free and open-source software projects.
             These different license elements are symbolized by visual icons, as shown
          in figures 3.3a to 3.3d below.
           The symbol shown in figure 3.3a means Attribution or “BY.” This license
          means that others who use your work must give you credit for it (i.e., attribute
          it to you) in the way you request. All of the licenses include this condition.

            Different license elements
             The symbol shown in figure 3.3b means NonCommercial or “NC,” which
            means the work is only available to be used for non-commercial purposes.
             Three of the CC licenses include this restriction.
              The symbol shown in figure 3.3c means ShareAlike or “SA,” which means
            that any adaptations and modified versions based on this work must adhere to
             the terms of the original license. Two of the CC licenses include this condition:
            Attribution-ShareAlike (CC BY-SA), and Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike
            (CC BY-NC-SA).
               The symbol shown in figure 3.3d means NoDerivatives or “ND,” which means
             that reusers cannot share adaptations or modified versions of the work. Two of
             the CC licenses include this restriction: Attribution-NoDerivs (CC BY-ND), and
           Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs (CC BY-NC-ND).
               When combined, these icons represent the six CC license options. The icons
             are also embedded in the “license icons,” which each represent a particular CC
             license type. The next section in this chapter, “License Types,” explores the six
             combinations in detail.

       PUBLIC DOMAIN TOOLS
         In addition to the CC license suite, Creative Commons also has two public
          domain tools, which are represented by the icons in figures 3.4a and 3.4b above.
          These public domain tools are not licenses.
            CC0 (figure 3.4a) enables creators to dedicate their works to the worldwide
          public domain to the greatest extent possible. Note that some jurisdictions do
          not allow creators to dedicate their works to the public domain, so CC0 has other
          legal mechanisms included to help deal with this situation where it applies.
          (There is more on this in section 3.3 “License Types.”)
            The Public Domain Mark (figure 3.4b) is a label used to mark works that are
          known to be free of all copyright restrictions. Unlike CC0, the Public Domain
          Mark is not a legal tool and has no legal effect when applied to a work. It serves
          only as a label to inform the public about the public domain status of a work and
         is often used by museums and archives working with very old works.
       Final Remarks
         There is a learning curve to some of the terminology and basics about how CC
          legal tools work. But as you now know, it is far less intimidating than it looks.
         Now that you understand how to “speak CC” and know some of the fundamentals
          about CC license design, you are well on your way to becoming versed in CC
          licensing.

          3.2 | LICENSE SCOPE
             Creative Commons licenses are built on copyright law. This simple fact tells
            you most of what you need to know about when they do and do not apply, and
             how long they last.
         LEARNING OUTCOMES
                  •  Describe how CC works with copyright and why this is important
                  •  Explain the time length of a CC license

          THE BIG QUESTION: WHY IT MATTERS
            What is the legal foundation upon which CC licenses operate? And why is this
            so important?
              CC licenses are copyright licenses. They apply where and when copyright
            applies. This reflects a fundamental design decision by the founders of Creative
            Commons. Given that the goal was to make more creative and educational
           works available under common-sense terms, Creative Commons wanted to
             ensure that its licenses were not used to restrict works or uses of works that the
             copyright law does not restrict. This is a core CC value. Having the language of
             the licenses track copyright law accomplished this goal.
          PERSONAL REFLECTION: WHY IT MATTERS TO YOU
            Think about what it would mean if a CC license could prevent you from doing
            something you could otherwise do with a copyrighted work, such as printing
             a copy of a poem to insert in a birthday card for a friend. Do you understand
            why having CC licenses track copyright was an important decision for the
           founders of Creative Commons?
         Acquiring Essential Knowledge
            The statement that “Creative Commons licenses are copyright licenses” tells
             you the following about the licenses:
                 1. The licenses “operate” or apply only when the work is within the scope
                    of copyright law (or other related laws) and the restrictions of copyright
                  law apply to the intended use of the work. (This is discussed in more
                    detail below.)
                 2. Certain other rights, such as patents, trademarks, and privacy and publicity
                   rights are not covered by the licenses and must be managed separately.

          - 46 - CHAPTER 3

             The first of these statements explains a basic limitation of the licenses in
          controlling what people do with the work, and the second statement provides a
          warning that there may be other rights at play with the work that restrict how
          it is used.
        WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR THE CC LICENSE TO APPLY
       WHERE COPYRIGHT APPLIES?
         CC licenses are appropriate for creators who have created something protectable
          by copyright, such as an image, an article, or a book, and who want to provide
         people with one or more of the permissions governed by copyright law.
          For example, if you want to give others permission to freely copy and redistribute
          your work, you can use a CC license to grant those permissions. Likewise,
          if you want to give others permission to freely transform, alter, or otherwise
          create derivative works based on your work, you can use a CC license to grant
         those permissions.
            However, you don’t need to use a Creative Commons license to give someone
         permission to read your article or watch your video, because reading and
          watching aren’t activities that copyright generally regulates.
            Here are two more important scenarios in which a user does not need a copyright
          license:1
              •  When fair use, fair dealing, or some other limitation and exception to
               copyright applies (see the relevant FAQ at https://creativecommons.org/
               faq/#do-creative-commons-licenses-affect-exceptions-and-limitations-to 
                -copyright-such-as-fair-dealing-and-fair-use ).
              •  When the work is in the public domain (see the relevant FAQ1 at https://
               creativecommons.org/faq/#may-i-apply-a-creative-commons-license-to-a 
               -work-in-the-public-domain).
        BECAUSE USERS DON’T NEED COPYRIGHT LICENSES IN THESE
        SCENARIOS, CC LICENSES AREN’T NEEDED
          Can you think of reasons why someone might try to apply a CC license to a work
         that is not covered by copyright in their own country? Or reasons why a CC
          licensor might expect attribution every time their work is used, even for a use
          that is not prohibited by copyright law?
            These users might be trying to exert control that they do not actually have
         by law. But more likely than not, they simply don’t know that copyright does

             not apply, or that a work is in the public domain. Or, for the savvy licensor, they
            may realize that their work is in the public domain in some countries but not
            everywhere, and they want to be sure that everyone everywhere will be able to
              reuse it.
               For a real-life example, let’s look at what happens when you want to use CC
            licenses in a field like 3D printing. Look at the resource provided by Public
            Knowledge (licensed CC BY-SA 3.0, available at https://www.publicknowledge 
            .org/assets/uploads/documents/3_Steps_for_Licensing_Your_3D_Printed_Stuff
             .pdf ) about how to apply a CC license in the 3D printing field. It is easy to see
            how complicated the legal issues can become, particularly in newly emerging
              fields like this one.
               One other subtle but important difference about the scope of CC licenses is
             that they also cover other rights that are closely related to copyright. These are
             defined as “Similar Rights” in the CC license legal code, and they include related
            and neighboring rights and what are known as “sui genesis database rights,”
             which are rights in some countries restricting the extraction and reuse of the
            contents of a database. See section 2.1 “Copyright Basics” for a refresher on
            what Similar Rights covers. Just as with copyright, the CC license conditions
             only come into play when Similar Rights otherwise apply to the work and to the
            particular reuse made by someone using the CC-licensed work.
                The other critical part of the statement “CC licenses are copyright licenses”
             is that there may be other rights in a work upon which the license has no effect—
             for example, privacy rights. Again, CC licenses do not have any effect on rights
             beyond copyright and Similar Rights as defined in the licenses, so other rights
             have to be managed separately. Read the FAQ about this issue at https://creative 
            commons.org/faq/#does-a-creative-commons-license-give-me-all-the-rights-i 
            -need-to-use-the-work.
               While it is not required, Creative Commons urges creators to make sure that
             there are no other rights that may prevent the reuse of their work as intended.
            CC licensors do not make any warranties about the reuse of the work. This
             means that unless the licensor is offering a separate warranty, it is incumbent
            on the reuser to determine whether other rights may impact their intended
            reuse of the work. Learning more about this can sometimes be as easy as contacting
             the licensor to inquire about these possible other rights. Read through
             the complete list of considerations for licensees of CC-licensed works, licensed
         CC BY 4.0, at https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Considerations_for 
            _licensors_and_licensees#Considerations_for_licensees.

          - 48 - CHAPTER 3

        WHAT TYPES OF CONTENT CAN BE CC-LICENSED?
         You can apply a CC license to anything protected by copyright that you own,
         with one important exception.
             CC urges creators not to apply CC licenses to software. This is because there
          are many free and open-source software licenses which do that job better; they
         were built specifically as software licenses. For example, most open-source
          software licenses include provisions about distributing the software’s source
          code—but the CC licenses do not address this important aspect of sharing software.
          The software-sharing ecosystem is well established, and there are many
         good open-source software licenses to choose from. An FAQ from Creative
         Commons’ website available at https://creativecommons.org/faq/#can-i-apply 
         -a-creative-commons-license-to-software  has more information about why we
          discourage the use of our licenses for software.
        WHOSE RIGHTS ARE COVERED BY THE CC LICENSE?
          A CC license on a given work only covers the copyright held by the person who
          applied the license—the licensor. This might sound obvious, but it is an important
         point to understand. For example, many employers own the copyright to
          works created by their employees, so if an employee applies a CC license to a
          work owned by their employer, they are not able to give any permission whatsoever
          to reuse the work. The person who applies the license needs to be either
          the creator or someone who has acquired the rights to the work.
            Additionally, a work may incorporate the copyrighted work of another, such
          as a scholarly article that uses a copyrighted photograph to illustrate an idea
          (after having received the permission of the owner of the photograph to include
          it). The CC license applied by the author of the scholarly article does not apply
          to the photograph, only to the remainder of the work. Separate permission may
          need to be obtained in order to reproduce the photograph (but not the remainder
          of the article). See section 3.4 “License Enforceability” for more details on
          how to handle these situations.
            Also, works often have more than one copyright attached to them. For example
          , a filmmaker may own the copyright to a film adaptation of a book, but the
          book author also holds a copyright to the book on which the film is based. In this
          example, if the film is CC-licensed, the CC license only applies to the film and not
          the book. The user may need to separately obtain a license to use the copyrightable
          content from the book that is part of the film.

         Final Remarks
           A key to understanding how Creative Commons works is understanding that
            the licenses depend on copyright to function. This seemingly simple concept
             explains a lot about when the tools apply and how much of a work they cover.
          3.3 | LICENSE TYPES
            There are six different CC licenses, which are designed to help accommodate
             the diverse needs of creators while still using simple, standardized terms.
         LEARNING OUTCOMES
                  •  Explain the CC license suite
                  •  Describe the different CC license elements

          THE BIG QUESTION: WHY IT MATTERS
            Why are there so many different Creative Commons licenses?
               There is no single Creative Commons license. The CC license suite (which
            includes the six CC licenses) and the CC0 Public Domain Dedication offer creators
             a range of options. At first, all of these choices can appear daunting. But
             when you dig into the options, you will realize that the spectrum of choices is
             fairly simple.
          PERSONAL REFLECTION: WHY IT MATTERS TO YOU
             Think about a piece of creative or academic work you made that you are particularly
             proud of. If you shared that work with others, would you have been okay
            with them adapting it or using it for commercial purposes? Why or why not?
         Acquiring Essential Knowledge
            Creative Commons licenses are standardized tools, but part of the vision is
             to provide a range of options for creators who are interested in sharing their
             works with the public rather than reserving all rights under copyright.
               The four license elements—BY, SA, NC, and ND—combine to make up six different
             license options.
                All of the licenses include the BY condition. In other words, all of the licenses
            require that the creator be attributed in connection with their work. Beyond
            that commonality, the licenses vary as to whether (1) commercial use of the
             work is permitted, and (2) whether the work can be adapted or modified, and if
             so, on what terms.

          granted reusers, are shown in figures 3.5a to 3.5f.
             The Attribution license, or CC BY (figure 3.5a), allows people to use the work
          for any purpose (even commercially and even in modified form) as long as they
          give attribution to the creator.
          The Attribution-ShareAlike license, or BY- S A (figure 3.5b), allows people to
         use the work for any purpose (even commercially and even in modified form),
          as long as they give attribution to the creator and make any adaptations they
          share with others available under the same or a compatible license. This is Creative
         Commons’ version of a copyleft license (a type of open source software
          license that makes the license permissions viral by design), and is the license
          required for the content uploaded to Wikipedia, for example.
             The Attribution-NonCommercial license, or BY-NC (figure 3.5c), allows people
          to use the work for noncommercial purposes only, and only as long as they give
          attribution to the creator.
          The Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike license, or BY-NC- S A (figure 3.5d),
         allows people to use the work for noncommercial purposes only, and only as
          long as they give attribution to the creator and make any adaptations they share
          with others available under the same or a compatible license.

            The Attribution-NoDerivatives license, or BY-N D (figure 3.5e), allows people
             to use the unadapted work for any purpose (even commercially), as long as they
            give attribution to the creator. But they cannot use adapted or modified versions
             of the work (these are called “derivatives”).
            The Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives license, or BY-NC-ND (figure
             3.5f), is the most restrictive license offered by Creative Commons. It allows people
            to use the unadapted work for noncommercial purposes only, and only as
             long as they give attribution to the licensor. Adaptations or modified versions
             of the work are not permitted.
               To really understand how the different license options work, let’s dig into
             the different license elements. Attribution is a part of all CC licenses, and we
             will dissect exactly what type of attribution is required in chapter 4. For now,
             let’s focus on what makes the licenses different.
         COMMERCIAL VS. NONCOMMERCIAL USE
           Noncommercial (NC)
            As we know, three of the licenses (BY-NC, BY-NC-SA, and
          BY-NC-ND) limit reuse of the work to noncommercial
            purposes only. In the legal code, a noncommercial purpose
             is defined as one that is “not primarily intended for
           or directed towards commercial advantage or monetary
            compensation.” This phrasing is intended to provide flexibility depending on
             the facts surrounding the reuse, without overly specifying exact situations that
            could exclude some prohibited and some permitted reuses.
               It is important to note that CC’s definition of NC depends on the use, not
             the user. If you are a nonprofit or charitable organization, your use of an NC- 
              licensed work could still run afoul of the NC restriction, and if you are a for-profit
            entity, your use of an NC-licensed work does not necessarily mean you have
             violated the license terms. For example, a nonprofit entity cannot sell another’s
            NC-licensed work for a profit, and a for-profit entity may use an NC-licensed
           work for noncommercial purposes. Whether a use is commercial depends on
             the specifics of the situation. See our CC “NonCommercial Interpretation” page,

          - 52 - CHAPTER 3

       ADAPTATIONS
         The other differences between the licenses hinge on whether, and on what
         terms, reusers can adapt and then share the licensed work. The question of
          what constitutes an adaptation of a licensed work depends on applicable copyright
          law (for a reminder, see chapter 2). One of the exclusive rights granted to
          creators under copyright is the right to create adaptations or modified versions
          of their works or, as they are sometimes called, “derivative works.” Examples
          of these adaptations include creating a movie based on a book or translating a
         book from one language to another.
             As a legal matter, at times it is tricky to determine exactly what is and is not
          an adaptation. Here are some handy rules about the licenses to keep in mind:
            Technical format-shifting (for example, converting a licensed work from
          a digital format to a physical copy) is not an adaptation regardless of what the
         applicable copyright law may otherwise provide.
              •  Fixing minor problems with spelling or punctuation is not an adaptation.
              •  Syncing a musical work with a moving image is an adaptation regardless
               of what the applicable copyright law may otherwise provide.
              •  Reproducing and putting works together into a collection is not an adaptation
               of the individual works. For example, combining stand-alone essays
                by several authors into an essay collection for use as an open textbook is a
               collection and not an adaptation. Most open courseware is a collection of
               others’ open educational resources (OER).
              •  Including an image in connection with text, as in a blog post, a Power-
                Point, or an article, does not create an adaptation unless the photo itself is
              adapted.
                           NoDerivatives
                             Two of the CC licenses (BY-ND and BY-NC-ND) prohibit reusers
                            from sharing (i.e., distributing or making available)
                             adaptations of the licensed work. To be clear, this means
                           that anyone may create adaptations of works under an ND
                             license so long as they don’t share the work with others in
          adapted form. This allows, among other things, organizations to engage in text
          and data mining without violating the ND term.

                            ShareAlike
                              Two of the licenses (BY-SA and BY-NC-SA) require that if
                               adaptations of the licensed work are shared, they must be
                               made available under the same or a compatible license. For
                                 ShareAlike purposes, the list of compatible licenses is short.
                                  It includes later versions of the same license (e.g., BY-SA 4.0
             is compatible with BY-SA 3.0) and a few non-CC licenses designated as compatible
            by Creative Commons (e.g., the Free Art License). You can read more about
             this at the CC wiki ShareAlike Compatibility page, licensed CC BY 4.0, available
              at  https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/ShareAlike_compatibility, but the
             most important thing to remember is that ShareAlike requires that if you share
             your adaptation, you must do so using the same or a compatible license.
                           Public Domain
                               In addition to the CC license suite, Creative Commons also
                              has an option for creators who want to take a “no rights
                                reserved” approach and disclaim copyright entirely. This is
                               CC0, the Public Domain Dedication tool.
                                   Like the CC licenses, CC0 (read “CC Zero”) uses the threelayer
            design—legal code, deed, and metadata. The CC0 legal code itself uses a
            three-pronged legal approach. The first approach is for the creator to simply
             waive all of their rights to the work. But some countries do not allow creators to
            dedicate their work to the public domain through a waiver or abandonment of
             their rights, so CC0 includes a “fallback” license that allows anyone in the world
            to do anything with the work unconditionally. The fallback license comes into
             play when the waiver fails for any reason. And finally, in the rare instance that
            both the waiver and the “fallback” license are not enforceable, CC includes a
             promise by the person applying CC0 to their work that they will not assert copyright
             against reusers in a manner that interferes with their stated intention of
             surrendering all rights in the work.
                Like the licenses, CC0 is a copyright tool, but it also covers a few additional
            rights beyond those covered by the CC licenses, such as noncompetition laws.
             From a reuse perspective, there still may be other rights that require clearance
             separately, such as trademark and patent rights, and third-party rights in the
             work, such as publicity or privacy rights.

       Final Remarks
         Creative Commons legal tools were designed to provide a solution to complicated
         laws in a standardized way, making them as easy as possible for nonlawyers
          to use and apply. Understanding the basic legal principles in this section
          will help you use the CC licenses and public domain tools more effectively.
        3.4 | LICENSE ENFORCEABILITY
          Creative Commons licenses have been carefully crafted to make them legally
          enforceable in countries around the world.
       LEARNING OUTCOMES
              •  Describe the state of Creative Commons case law
              •  Explain the potential benefits of seeking nonlegal resolutions 
              to disagreements
        THE BIG QUESTION: WHY IT MATTERS
          Creative Commons licenses are legal tools that build on copyright law. As legal
          instruments, CC licenses need to stand up in court. What happens when there is
          a court case that involves CC licenses? What happens if someone is violating the
          CC license you applied to a work, but you don’t want to file a lawsuit? What happens
         if a licensor complains about how you have attributed them when reusing
         their work?
            To date and to our knowledge, no court around the world that has heard a
          case involving a CC license (and there have been very few such cases) has questioned
          the validity or enforceability of a CC license. Thanks to the Creative Commons
         community, most disputes connected to CC licenses are resolved outside
          of court and often without involving lawyers.
        PERSONAL REFLECTION: WHY IT MATTERS TO YOU
         Whether you or your organization are using CC licenses, or you’re advising
          others in the use of such licenses, you want to be confident that the terms of
         those licenses are enforceable. If someone misuses your work, what recourse
         do you have? What would you do if you found out that someone was using your
          CC-licensed photograph in a magazine without giving you credit, for example?

         Acquiring Essential Knowledge
            Most people who reuse CC-licensed works try to comply with the license conditions.
            But whether well-meaning or not, sometimes people get it wrong.
               If someone is using a CC-licensed work without giving attribution or otherwise
            following the license, their right to use the work ends automatically
            as soon as they violate the license terms. Unless the person using the work
            received separate permission or is relying upon fair use or some other exception
            to copyright, they are potentially liable for copyright infringement. To
            learn what happens when someone does not comply with a CC license, read the
           FAQ at https://creativecommons.org/faq/#what-happens-if-i-offer-my-material 
            -under-a-creative-commons-license-and-someone-misuses-them. For a look at
             what happens from the perspective of a reuser, read the FAQ at https://creative

               Note this important difference between the newest version of CC licenses
             (Version 4.0) and prior versions in the text box below:





                       Under Version 4.0, users of CC-licensed works who come into compliance
                       with license terms within thirty days of discovering they were in violation
                       of the terms have their rights under the license automatically reinstated.

                   FIGURE 3.6 What’s new in Version 4.0 of the CC licenses?
                   From the “What’s New in 4.0 Page” on the Creative Commons website: https://
                    creativecommons.org/share-your-work/licensing-considerations/version4/
                   CC BY 4.0
                Sometimes these types of disputes can end up in court. Over the course of Creative
            Commons’ history, to our knowledge, there have been very few legal disputes
             and decisions involving CC legal tools. Each court that has rendered a decision
             has made it without questioning the enforceability of the CC license at issue.

          - 56 - CHAPTER 3

            Those judicial decisions have been in a variety of places around the world,
         including Spain, Belgium, Netherlands, Germany, Sweden, Israel, and the
          United States. Creative Commons maintains a listing of court decisions and case
          law from jurisdictions around the world on its wiki, licensed CC BY 4.0, available
         at https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Case_Law.
             In all of these decisions, no court has questioned the validity of a CC license
          in the case. While a CC license played a minor role in some of the cases, in others
          the court has held the defendant liable for copyright infringement for failing to
          follow the CC license terms. You can read about one such decision at the CC wiki
          page Curry v. Audax, licensed CC BY 4.0 and available at https://wiki.creative 
         commons.org/wiki/Curry_v._Audax.
              Legal enforceability is one of the key features of CC licensing. While the licenses
         are widely seen as symbols of free and open sharing, they also carry legal
          weight. The CC legal code was written by lawyers with the help of a global network
          of international copyright experts. The result is a set of terms and conditions
          that are intended to operate and be enforceable everywhere in the world.
        LICENSE VERSIONS
         As noted above, there are different versions of CC licenses. These are not to
         be confused with the different types of licenses described in section 3.3. The
         license version number simply represents when that particular version of the
         CC legal code was written. Creative Commons improves its licenses through
          the process of versioning, by which we update the legal code to better account
          for changes in copyright law and technology, and the needs of reusers. While
          there are some differences between license versions, the different versions are
          largely the same in practical effect. The latest version of the CC license suite is
          Version 4.0, which was published in 2013. Details on what updates were made to
          the licenses in Version 4.0 can be found at https://creativecommons.org/share 
          -your-work/licensing-considerations/version4. For the most definitive and comprehensive
          view of how the licenses have changed from Version 1.0 to the present
          , including all changes to the attribution and marking requirements, visit
          the CC wiki page, licensed CC BY 4.0, available at https://wiki.creativecommons 
         .org/wiki/License_Versions.
             In all cases, we recommend that creators use the latest version of the licenses,
          because it reflects the latest thinking of Creative Commons and its global network
          of legal experts.

          OFFICIAL TRANSLATIONS OF CC LEGAL TOOLS
             The latest versions of all the CC licenses (and other tools) may be translated
            into official versions in other languages. Creative Commons has a formal process
             (see the Legal Code Translation Policy, licensed CC BY 4.0 and available
             at https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Legal_Code_Translation_Policy) by
             which this is done in order to ensure that the translations are as close to the
             original as possible. Creative Commons’ goal is to get the licenses into as many
            languages as possible, so that everyone can read and understand the terms in
             their native language. The official translations are noted at the bottom of the
             legal code on all of the licenses and are equivalents of one another.
               Many people ask about the relationship between the official translations and
             the English originals. All official translations are linguistic translations only,
             unlike ported versions (which are described in the text box below). The official
            translations are legal equivalents of one another, which means they have the
             same legal meaning and effect in each language. This is similar to how standards
            bodies such as the World Wide Web Consortium translate a single standard
             into many different languages, and how the United Nations publishes treaties.
          RESOLVING DISPUTES
             Since the publication of Version 1.0 of the licenses in 2002, Creative Commons
            is aware of a relatively small number of disputes between licensors and reusers
             over its licenses, including the NonCommercial term and attribution. There
             may be several explanations for this state of harmony. As observed by Creative
            Commons in its “Defining ‘Noncommercial’” report (licensed CC BY 3.0 and

            Distinguishing ported versions of the pre-4.0 versions of the CC licenses.
              Prior to the publication of Version 4.0 in November 2013, Creative Commons gave permission
              to the CC Global Network to “port” the Creative Commons licenses. Porting involved
              linguistic translation and adjustments so that the licenses reflected local terminology and
              drafting protocols, and it accounted for other local differences, such as the existence of moral
              rights and collecting societies.
                One of the primary reasons for versioning the licenses from 3.0 to 4.0 was to eliminate
              the need for porting, an unnecessarily complex process that could be eliminated if Creative
              Commons took proper care to ensure that the new licenses were internationalized. Starting
              with Version 4.0, the most recent version of the CC license suite, Creative Commons no
              longer “ports” the licenses. The ported licenses of previous versions may still be used and
              remain legally valid and enforceable; however, Creative Commons discourages their use
              and recommends Version 4.0 as the latest and most up-to-date thinking of CC and its global 
             network.

          - 58 - CHAPTER 3

          available  at  https://mirrors.creativecommons.org/defining-noncommercial/
         Defining_Noncommercial_fullreport.pdf  ), the expectations of licensors and
          reusers of CC-licensed content may play a role here. For example, NC licensors
          often intend for broad reuse of their NC-licensed content, as long as it is not
         reused primarily for commercial gain. However, the reusers of NC-licensed
         content may assume more conservative license terms around commercial
          reuse. As a result, NC-licensed content is not often reused to the full extent
          of the permissions that the license affords or the licensor intends. And often,
          when disputes around CC-licensed content do arise, they are resolved amicably
          and out of court, frequently without involving lawyers. Instead, disputes are
          resolved through outreach by the licensor to the user, and an accord is struck to
          fix any actual problem.
            Note that Creative Commons accounted for this practice in Version 4.0.
          Whereas prior to 4.0, any violation of the license automatically terminated the
          license, and the violator had to seek new and express permission from the licensor
          to reuse the work again, in Version 4.0, the license automatically reinstates
          if the violator corrects the problem within thirty days of having become aware
          of it. This encourages reusers to do the right thing—correct their violations as
          soon as possible upon discovery, whether or not the licensor has made a claim.
          This can help avoid disputes.
            In many ways, both of these practices—being more generous and respectful,
         and outreach to solve any perceived violations—are a testament to the values
          held and practiced by the CC community of creators and reusers. Creative Commons
          encourages healthy, open interactions between licensors and those reusing
          their works.
       Final Remarks
          The legal robustness of the CC licenses is critically important. With the help
          of an international network of legal and policy experts, the CC licenses are
          accepted and enforceable worldwide. To date, no court has declared the licenses
          unenforceable, and very few lawsuits have ensued. In the vast majority of cases,
         the CC community has resolved any disputes outside of the courtroom.

        NOTE
              1. Remember that the term of copyright for works varies around the world. So, in
                some situations, a work may be in the public domain under the laws of Uganda
                but not in the public domain under the laws of Indonesia. This means that
                depending on the law that applies to your use (generally, where you are when
                using the work), the CC license may or may not apply.

                  CC-Licensed Works
         NOW THAT YOU KNOW HOW THE CC LICENSES WORK AND HOW THEY ARE
            designed, you are ready to use CC licenses and CC0 for your own work, and
            reuse CC-licensed works created by others.
               This chapter covers what you need to know as a CC licensor and as a reuser.
            When your own CC-licensed work incorporates CC-licensed work made by others
             , you are both!

       LEARNING OUTCOMES
              •  Name the most important considerations before applying a CC license 
              or CC0
              •  Apply a license using CC’s License Chooser and a CC0 using CC’s Public
             Domain Dedication
              •  Evaluate which license to apply based on the relevant factors

        THE BIG QUESTION: WHY IT MATTERS
         What should creators consider before applying a CC license or CC0 to their
         work? There are several options for creators who choose to share their work
          by using CC. There are also many things to think about before applying any CC
          license or CC0, including whether you have all the rights you need and if not,
          how you must indicate that to the public.
        PERSONAL REFLECTION: WHY IT MATTERS TO YOU
         How would you go about choosing a particular CC license for your work? Do
         you know how to go about actually attaching a license to your work once you
         have chosen one? What if you change your mind about the license?
       Acquiring Essential Knowledge
          Before you decide that you want to apply a CC license or CC0 to your creative
          work, there are some important things to consider:
              •  The licenses and CC0 are irrevocable. The word irrevocable means that a
               legal agreement cannot be canceled. This means that once you apply a CC
                license to a work, that license applies to the work until the copyright on
                the work expires. This aspect of CC licensing is highly desirable from the
                perspective of reusers because they can be confident that the creator cannot
                arbitrarily pull back the rights granted them under the CC license.
                     »» Because the licenses are irrevocable, it is very important to care-
                     fully consider your options before deciding to apply a CC license to
                    a work.
              •  You must own or control copyright in the work. You should control copy-
                right in the work to which you apply the CC license. For example, you don’t
               own or control any copyright in a work that is in the public domain, and
               you don’t own or control the copyright to an Enrique Iglesias song. Fur-

                 thermore, if you created the material in the scope of your employment,
                 you may not be the holder of the rights and may need to get permission
                  from your employer before applying a CC license to it. Before licensing,
                  be mindful about whether you have copyright to the work to which you’re
                  applying a CC license.
          WHICH CREATIVE COMMONS LICENSE SHOULD I USE?
            The six CC licenses provide a range of options for creators who want to share
            their work with the public while still retaining copyright. The best way to
            decide which license is appropriate for you is to think about why you want to
            share your work, and how you hope others will use that work.
                For example, here are a few questions to consider:
                  •  Do you think people might make interesting new works out of your creation
                   ? Do you want to give people the ability to translate your writing into
                  different languages, or otherwise customize it for their own needs? If so,
                  then you should choose a license that allows your work to be adapted.
                  •  Is it important to you that your images are able to be incorporated into
                 Wikipedia? If so, then you should choose either CC BY, BY-SA, or CC0,
                 because Wikipedia does not allow images licensed under any of the Non-
                  Commercial or NoDerivatives licenses except in limited circumstances.
                  •  Do you want to give away all of your rights in your work so that it can
                 be used by anyone in the world for any purpose? Then you might want to
                  think about using the Public Domain Dedication tool, CC0.
                If you need some help deciding which license might be best for you, this flowchart
            from CC Australia might be useful (please note that the information it
             contains is not legal advice): see figure 4.2 or go to http://creativecommons.org 
            .au/learn/fact-sheets/licensing-flowchart/ .
          HOW DO I APPLY A CC LICENSE TO MY WORK?
            Once you’ve decided you want to use a CC license and know which license you
             want to use, applying it is simple. Technically, all you have to do is indicate
            which CC license you are applying to your work. However, we strongly recommend
            including a link (or writing out the CC license URL, if you are working
             offline) to the relevant CC license deed (e.g., https://creativecommons.org/
             licenses/by/4.0). You can do this in the copyright notice for your work, on the

              FIGURE 4.3 Screenshot of the footer of BC Open Textbooks

             footer of your website, or any other place that makes sense in light of the particular
            format and medium of your work. The important thing is to make it clear
             what the CC license covers and locate the notice in a place which makes that clear
            to the public. See “Marking Your Work with a CC License” (licensed CC BY 4.0
            and available at https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Marking_your_work 
            _with_a_CC_license) on the Creative Commons website for more information.
               Indicating which CC license you choose can be as simple as the notice from
             the footer of BC Open Textbooks (https://open.bccampus.ca/find-open-textbooks), 
             shown in figure 4.3.
                If you are on a platform like Medium or Flickr, you should use the built-in CC
             license tools on the platform to mark your work with the CC license you choose.
               If you have a personal blog or a website, we recommend using the CC license
            chooser to generate code that identifies your chosen license. That code can be
            copied and inserted into your work online.
               You should take some time to play around with the CC license chooser, at
            https://creativecommons.org/choose/, now (figure 4.4). After you select the
            boxes that indicate your preferences, the chooser generates the appropriate
             license based on your selections. Remember, the license chooser is not a registration
            page, it simply provides you with standardized HTML code, icons and
             license statements.
                In figure 4.4, do you see the text and icon just above the code? That text/links
             can also be copied and pasted onto your work to mark the work with a CC license.
               If you want to mark the work in a different way or need to use a different
             format like closing titles in a video, you can visit https://creativecommons.org/
            about/downloads/ and access downloadable versions of all of the CC icons.

          How to Apply a CC0 License
              Like the licenses, CC0 has its own chooser. If you want to dedicate your work to the public
              domain, you can go to https://creativecommons.org/choose/zero/waiver. Complete the
              required fields, agree to the terms, and then get the metadata to mark your work with a CC0
              license.

              Whatever method you use to mark your content, there are several important
             steps for proper CC license marking. Here are three cases in which you will
            mark CC-licensed works:
                  1. Marking your own work so that others can easily discover it, reuse it, and
                   give you credit or attribution. The best practice for marking your work
                   is to follow the TASL approach for your own portions of the content, and
                    for the portions of the content created by others:
                        »» T = Title
                        »» A = Author (tell reusers who to give credit to)
                        »» S = Source (give reusers a link to the resource)
                        »» L = License (provide a link to the CC license deed)
                   When providing attribution, the goal is to mark the work with full TASL
                  information. When you don’t have some of the TASL information about
                   a work, do the best you can and include as much detail as possible in the
                  marking statement.
                      You should note that starting with Version 4.0, the licenses no longer
                    require a reuser to include the title as part of the attribution statement.
                   However, if the title is provided, then Creative Commons encourages you
                    to include it when attributing the author.
                    For more examples of how to mark your own work in different contexts
                  , spend some time looking through Creative Commons’ extensive
                  marking page “Marking Your Work with a CC License” (licensed CC BY
                   4.0 and available at https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Marking 
                   _your_work_with_a_CC_license). See the caption of figure 4.5 as an example
                   of marking an image with TASL information. It is a good example of
                  CC marking because TASL with all appropriate links is provided in the
                   attribution statement.
                 2. Indicating if your work is based on someone else’s work. If your work is a
                   modification or adaptation of another work, you should indicate this and
                   provide attribution to the creator of the original work. You should also
                   include a link to the work you modified and indicate what license applies
                    to that work. Figure 4.6 is an example of this.
                 3. Marking work created by others that you are incorporating into your own
                   work. Figure 4.7 is an example here from a Saylor Academy course.

          know who created which parts of the work. To do this, you should (1) identify
          the terms under which any given work, or part of a work, can be used, and (2)
         provide information about the works you used to create your new work or that
         you incorporated into your work.
       Final Remarks
          When applying a CC license to a work, you should (1) use the CC license chooser 
          to determine which CC license best meets your needs. Apply the license code if
          possible, or copy and paste the text and links provided. (2) If you are using an
          online platform, use the built-in CC license tools to mark your work with a CC
          license. (3) Mark your work and give proper attribution to others’ works using
         the TASL approach.

                There is no single answer for which CC license is the best one for your work.
            It is important to remember why you are sharing your work and what you hope
             others might do with it, before making your CC license choice.
          4.2 | THINGS TO CONSIDER AFTER CC LICENSING
            Applying a CC license alone is not enough to ensure that your work is freely
             available for easy reuse and remix. Licensors must also consider additional factors
             that affect the accessibility and usability of their works for future users.

          - 70 - CHAPTER 4

        THE BIG QUESTION: WHY IT MATTERS
          One of the most important aspects of Creative Commons licenses is that they are
         standardized. This makes it much easier for the public to understand how the
          licenses work and what reusers have to do to meet their obligations.
            But CC licenses do not apply to works in a vacuum. CC-licensed works usually
          live on websites that have their own terms of service. Or sometimes, these
         works are not in formats that make it easy to reuse or adapt them. And the
          works are often available in hard-copy form for a price.
        PERSONAL REFLECTION: WHY IT MATTERS TO YOU
         Have you ever found a CC-licensed work that you weren’t easily able to copy
          and share? What made it hard to reuse as intended? Was it an issue of technical
          format, or were there access restrictions on the work, or something else?
       Acquiring Essential Knowledge
         Creative Commons licenses are standardized licenses, which means the terms
          and conditions are the same for all works subject to the same type of CC license.
          This is an essential feature of their design, enabling the public to remix CC- 
          licensed works. It also makes the licenses easy to understand.
            But people and institutions that use the licenses have diverse needs and
          wants. Sometimes creators want slightly different terms rather than the standard
          terms that CC licenses offer.
            Creative Commons strongly discourages people from customizing open
          copyright licenses because this creates confusion, requires users to take the
          time to learn about how the custom license differs, and eliminates the benefits
          of standardization. If you change any of the terms and conditions of a CC
          license, you cannot call it a Creative Commons license or otherwise use the CC
          trademarks. This rule also applies if you try to add restrictions on what people
         can do with CC-licensed work through your separate agreements, such as website
          terms of service. For example, your website’s terms of service can’t tell people
          they can’t copy a CC-licensed work (if they are complying with the license
         terms). You can, however, make your CC-licensed work available on more permissive
         terms and still call it a CC license. For example, you may waive your
          right to receive attribution.
            Creative Commons has a detailed legal policy, Modifying the CC Licenses,
         (licensed CC BY 4.0 and available at https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/
          Modifying_the_CC_licenses) which outlines these rules. However, the best way
          to apply them is to ask yourself: “Is what I want to do going to make it easier or

[Link]

             harder for people to use my CC-licensed work?” If the latter, then generally it’s
            a restriction and you can’t do it unless you remove the Creative Commons name
            from the work.
               Note that all of the above applies to creators of CC-licensed work. You can
             never change the legal terms that apply to someone else’s CC-licensed work.
          CHARGING FOR A CC-LICENSED WORK
             The first part of this section dealt with the requirements connected to changing
             the legal terms on a CC-licensed work, whether by actually changing the license
             terms or using separate contracts to try to do so.
                But what if you simply want to sell a CC-licensed work?
                If you are the creator, then selling your work is always okay. In fact, selling
             physical copies (e.g., a textbook) and providing digital copies for free is a very
            common method for making money while using CC licenses.
               Figure 4.8 highlights Cards Against Humanity, a card game available under
            a Creative Commons BY-NC-SA 2.0 license. Cards Against Humanity offers their
             cards decks online for free download but sells physical copies.
                Charging for access to digital copies of a CC-licensed work is more difficult. It
             is permissible, but once someone pays for a copy of your work, they can legally
             distribute it to others for free under the terms of the applicable CC license.

          - 72 - CHAPTER 4

             If you are charging for access to someone else’s CC-licensed work—whether a
          physical copy or digital version—you have to pay attention to the particular CC
          license applied to the work. If the CC license includes the NonCommercial (NC)
          restriction, then you cannot charge the public to access the work.
       MAKING YOUR WORK ACCESSIBLE
         Formats: Simply applying a CC license to a creative work does not necessarily
          make it easy for others to reuse and remix it. Think about what technical format
         you are using for your content (e.g., PDF or MP3). Can people download
          your work? Can they easily edit or remix it if the license allows? In addition
          to the final polished version, many creators distribute editable source files of
          their content to make it easier for those who want to use the work for their own
         purposes. For example, in addition to the physical book or e-book, you might
          want to distribute files of a CC-licensed book that enable people to easily cut and
          paste the content into their own works.
            DRM: Using a distribution platform that applies digital rights management
         (DRM), such as copy protection technology, to your work is another way you
          can inadvertently make it very hard for reusers to make use of the permissions
          in the CC license. If you have to upload your CC-licensed works to a platform
          that uses DRM, you should consider also distributing the same content on sites
         that do not use DRM.
            Note that the CC licenses prohibit you from applying DRM to someone else’s
         CC-licensed work without their permission.
        WHAT IF YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND ABOUT THE CC LICENSE?
          Inevitably, there are creators who apply a CC license to a work and then later
          decide they want to offer that work on different terms. Even though the original
          license cannot be revoked, the creator is free to also offer the work under a different
          license. Similarly, the creator is free to remove the copy of the work that
          they placed online.
            In these cases, anyone who finds the work under the original license is
          legally permitted to use it under those terms until the copyright expires. But as
          a practical matter, reusers may want to comply with the creator’s new wishes as
          a matter of respect.

         WHAT IF SOMEONE DOES SOMETHING WITH MY CC-LICENSED WORK
           I DON’T LIKE?
            As long as users abide by the license terms and conditions, authors/licensors
             cannot control how their material is used. That said, all CC licenses provide several
             mechanisms that allow licensors to choose not to be associated with their
             material, or to uses of their material with which they disagree.
                  •  First, all CC licenses prohibit using the attribution requirement to suggest
                   that the licensor endorses or supports a particular use.
                  •  Second, licensors may waive the attribution requirement, choosing not to
                    be identified as the licensor, if they wish.
                  •  Third, if the licensor does not like how the material has been modified or
                   used, CC licenses require that the licensee remove the attribution information
                  upon request. (In Version 3.0 and earlier, this is only a requirement
                   for adaptations and collections; in 4.0, this also applies to the unmodified
                 work.)
                  •  Finally, anyone modifying licensed material must indicate that the
                  original has been modified. This ensures that changes made to the original
                 material—whether or not the licensor approves of them—are not
                   attributed back to the licensor.
                  •  Furthermore, it is important to remember that:
                        »» The Commons is full of good people who want to do the right thing,
                       so we rarely see much “abuse” of openly licensed works. Using CC
                        licenses gives good, responsible people the freedom to use and
                       build on your work.
                        »» Copyright and/or open copyright licenses don’t keep “bad” people
                        from doing “bad” things with your work if they don’t care about
                          copyright in the first place.
          LEGAL CASES: OPEN EDUCATION
             In the sixteen years since our licenses were first published, the number of lawsuits
             turning on the interpretation of a CC license has been extremely low, especially
             considering that more than 1.6 billion CC-licensed works are available on
             the Internet. CC licenses have fared incredibly well in court, and disputes are
            rare when compared to the number of lawsuits between the parties to privately
             negotiated, custom licenses.1

[Link]
https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/legalcode
          - 74 - CHAPTER 4

             In 2017−18 there were three legal cases that involved CC licenses: Great Minds
          vs. FedEx Office, Great Minds vs. Office Depot, and Philpot vs. Media Research
          Center. The outcomes of the court decisions for these three cases favored the
          enforceability of CC licenses and their role in enabling the sharing of content
          with the public.
          Great Minds vs. FedEx Office and Great Minds vs. Office Depot
          Two of the three cases were raised by Great Minds, a curriculum developer.2 In
         these two cases, Great Minds received public funding from New York State to
          develop OER (open educational resources) for school districts, which the organization
          licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0. Great Minds brought the court cases
          against commercial copy shops that were hired by school districts to reproduce
         NC-licensed OER. The OER were for school use, which qualified as a noncommercial
         purpose.
            Great Minds made a common assertion in both cases: school districts are not
          allowed to outsource the reproduction of educational materials licensed under 
         CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 to contractors (the contractors were the commercial print
          shops in these cases) that make a profit on those reproductions. Great Minds’
          theory was that it was lawful for a school district employee to go to a copy shop
          and pay to use their copiers; however, if the same school employee paid the copy
          shop to hit “PRINT” instead, the copy shop is no longer working on behalf of, or
          under the direction of the school district—but is instead acting independently;
          therefore, the copy shop has to directly rely on its own NC license to make and
          charge a fee for the very same copies.
            Because they had applied a noncommercial license to their OER, Great Minds
         claimed that the school districts working with the OER were not allowed to
          engage FedEx or Office Depot to reproduce the materials, and that because the
          copy shops had made a profit, they had violated the license. Importantly, Great
          Minds never alleged that the school districts’ use of the reproduced materials
          violated the noncommercial restriction of the license.
             The central question in both cases was whether a licensee (a school district
         that is properly using the work for noncommercial purposes) may outsource
         the reproduction of the works to another entity that makes a profit on those
          reproductions, without the entity it pays becoming a copyright infringer under
          the NC license.

                In both cases, the district courts agreed with the copy shop and found that no
            copyright infringement or violation of the CC license had occurred. For additional
             details on the court cases, see the Additional Resources section at the end
              of this chapter.
            Philpot vs. Media Research Center
            The third case, Philpot vs. Media Research Center, Inc.,3 involved Larry Philpot
            , who voluntarily shared two photographs on Wikimedia under a Creative
            Commons license. Philpot complained that Media Research Center (MRC) had
             infringed his copyrights when it published his photographs in articles without 
             attribution.
               Following discovery (the phase of litigation during which factual evidence
            is gathered), MRC filed a motion for a summary judgment asking the court to
             find that it had not infringed Philpot’s copyrights because it used the photos
            for purposes of news and commentary, and those uses constitute fair use under
             U.S. copyright law.
               In its decision granting the motion for summary judgment, the U.S. District
            Court for the Eastern District of Virginia rejected Philpot’s argument that
            a “meeting of the minds” had to occur before the CC license used by Philpot
            applied.
               The district court ultimately found that MRC’s uses of the two photographs
             constituted fair use under U.S. copyright law, and as a result MRC had not violated
             Philpot’s copyrights. The court concluded that because fair use applied,
             attribution under the CC license was not required, and so MRC had not infringed
             Philpot’s copyrights. Compliance with the license had not been violated because
             a copyright license does not apply where fair use applies.
                Fair use eliminates the need to rely on or comply with a CC license. This is the
            core design of all CC licenses—CC licenses grant permission when permission
            is required under copyright law. They communicate the licensor’s intention to
            grant permission where permission is needed. And CC licenses are designed to
             be effective and enforceable without necessarily meeting the requirements of a
             contract. The law of contracts or obligations varies around the world, and there
             are some legal systems that may treat CC licenses as enforceable under the law
             of obligations. This court correctly determined that under U.S. law the licenses
            effectively grant permission without needing to meet the formal requirements
             of a contract because the intention to grant permission is all that is needed.

       Final Remarks
         Sharing your content using Creative Commons licenses is generous, but that
          alone is not enough to make it easy for others to reuse and remix your work.
         You should spend some time thinking from the perspective of someone who
         finds your shared content. How easy is it for them to download, reuse, and
          revise it? Are there legal or technical obstacles that make it difficult for them to
          do the things the CC license is designed to allow?
        4.3 | FINDING AND REUSING CC-LICENSED WORKS
         The “knowledge commons” of CC-licensed and public domain works is a plentiful
          resource that is available to all of us. But when you draw from it, remember
          to give credit to the creator and follow the other relevant license terms.
       LEARNING OUTCOMES
              •  Search for and discover CC-licensed works
              •  Give proper attribution when reusing CC-licensed works

        THE BIG QUESTION: WHY IT MATTERS
         There are more than a billion CC-licensed works on the web. How do you find
          what might be useful to you? And once you do, what do you need to do when you
          reuse it?
            There are several different ways to go about discovering CC-licensed works.
          Search engines can help you search across the web, or you can target particular
          platforms or sites. When you find a work to reuse, the most important thing to
          do is provide proper attribution to the work’s licensor.
        PERSONAL REFLECTION: WHY IT MATTERS TO YOU
          Think about a few of the CC-licensed works you have seen or interacted with.
          How did you find them? Did you know how to attribute the author if you shared
         the work?
       Acquiring Essential Knowledge
         When you are seeking CC-licensed works to reuse, there are several strategies
          to consider. One good starting point is CC Search (https://search.creative

            commons.org/), which is a tool that lets you search twelve major repositories
            of CC content online. Creative Commons is currently working on a project to
             improve the search tools it offers to help people discover works in the commons.
            Check out the prototype of a new version of CC Search at (https://ccsearch. 
            creativecommons.org/), which lets you create and save lists of works you like
             and includes a tool that enables you to give attribution with a single click.
               These search tools only scratch the surface of what is in the commons. Many
             platforms that enable the CC licensing of works shared on their sites also have
             their own search filters to find CC content, like OER Commons.
               If there is a particular type of content you’re looking for, you may be able
            to narrow down particular sources to explore. Wikipedia offers a fairly comprehensive
            listing (licensed CC BY-SA 3.0) of many major sources of CC material
              across various domains at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_major 
           _Creative_Commons_licensed_works.
               You can also search for works under a particular CC license. Take a look at
            the Creative Commons overview of each license that includes examples of projects
             and people using those licenses:
                  •  You can find examples of use organized by CC license at https://creative 
                commons.org/share-your-work/licensing-types-examples/licensing 
                 -examples/.
                  •  You can find examples of works placed into the public domain using CC0
                 at https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/.
         REUSING CC CONTENT
            When you find a CC work you want to reuse, the single most important thing
             to know is how to provide attribution. All CC licenses require that attribution be
             given to the creator. (Remember that unlike the CC licenses, CC0 is not a license
             but a Public Domain Dedication tool, so it does not require attribution in its
             terms. Nevertheless, giving credit or citing the source is typically considered
             best practice even when not legally required.)
            The elements of attribution are simple, though generally speaking, the
            more information you can provide, the better. People like to understand where
            CC-licensed works come from, and creators like to know that their names will
            remain attached to their works. If an author has provided extensive information
             in their attribution notice, you should retain it where possible.

          - 78 - CHAPTER 4

             As mentioned in section 4.1, the best practice for attribution is applying the
         TASL approach.
                  T = Title
               A = Author
                 S = Source
                 L = License
            The attribution requirements in the CC licenses are purposely designed to
          be fairly flexible in order to account for the many ways content is used. A filmmaker
          will have different options for giving credit than a scientist publishing
         an academic paper. Explore the CC wiki page “Best Practices for Attribution”
          (licensed CC BY 4.0 and available at https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/
          Best_practices_for_attribution). Among the options listed, think about how you
          would prefer to be attributed for your own work.
            Creative Commons is also exploring ways to automate attribution. Explore
          this feature by going to the CC search tool (https://ccsearch.creativecommons 
          .org) and searching for “golden retrievers.” Then, click on a couple of different
          photos to see how attribution is given, and experiment with the “copy credit as
          text” and “copy credit as HTML” functions.
            The other main consideration when copying works (as opposed to remixing,
         which will be covered in the next section of this chapter) is the NonCommercial
          restriction. If the work you are using is published with one of the three CC
          licenses that includes the NC element, then you need to make sure that you’re
          not using it for a commercial purpose.
            Remember, you can always reach out to the creator if you want to request
          extra permission beyond what the license allows.
       Final Remarks
          Attribution is arguably the single most important aspect of Creative Commons
         licensing. Think about why you want credit for your own work, even when it
         may not be legally required. What value does attribution provide to authors,
          and to the public who comes across the work online?

          4.4 | REMIXING CC-LICENSED WORKS
            Combining and adapting CC-licensed works is where things can get a little
             tricky. This section will give you the tools you need.
         LEARNING OUTCOMES
                  •  Describe the basics of what it means to create an adaptation
                  •  Explain the scope of the ShareAlike clause
                  •  Explain the scope of the NoDerivatives clause
                  •  Identify what license compatibility means and how to determine whether
                  licenses are compatible
          THE BIG QUESTION: WHY IT MATTERS
             The great promise of Creative Commons licensing is that it increases the pool of
            content from which we can draw to create new works. But to take advantage of
            this potential, you have to understand when and how you can incorporate and
            adapt CC-licensed works. This requires careful attention to the particular CC
             licenses that apply, as well as a working understanding of the legal concept of
             adaptations as a matter of copyright.
          Personal Reflection: Why It Matters to You
            Have you ever wondered how to use a CC-licensed work created by someone else
            in something you are creating? Have you ever come across a CC-licensed work
            you wanted to reuse, but were unsure about whether doing so would require
             you to apply a ShareAlike license to what you created?
         Acquiring Essential Knowledge
            Copying a CC-licensed work and sharing it is pretty simple. Just make sure to
            provide attribution and refrain from using the work for commercial purposes
             if it is licensed with one of the NonCommercial licenses.
               But what if you are changing a CC-licensed work or incorporating it into a
            new work? First, remember that if your use of someone else’s CC-licensed work
             falls under an exception or limitation to copyright (like fair use or fair dealing),
             then you have no obligations under the CC license. But if that is not the case,
            then you need to rely on the CC license for permission to adapt the work. The
             threshold question then becomes, is what you are doing creating an adaptation?

          - 80 - CHAPTER 4

             An “adaptation” (or a “derivative work,” as it is called in some parts of the
         world) is a special term in copyright law.4 It means a “modified” or “transformed”
          work that has been created from a copyrighted work and that is sufficiently
          original to itself to be protected by copyright. (It can thus be regarded as
          a “new” work.) Whether a transformed work differs sufficiently from the original
          work to be called an “adaptation” is not always easy to determine, though
          some bright lines do exist. Read the explanation on the Creative Commons site
          at https://creativecommons.org/faq/#what-is-an-adaptation about what constitutes
          an adaptation. Some examples of adaptations include a film based on a
          novel and a translation of a book from one language into another.
             Keep in mind that not all changes to a work result in the creation of an adaptation
          —such as spelling corrections. Also remember that to constitute an adaptation
          , the resulting work must be considered based on or derived from the original.
          This means that if you use a few lines from a poem to illustrate a poetry
          technique in an article you’re writing, your article is not an adaptation because
          your article is not derived from or based on the poem from which you took a few
          lines. However, if you rearranged the stanzas in the poem and added new lines,
          then almost certainly the resulting work would be considered an adaptation.
            Here are some particular types of adaptations to consider (some of them
          should be familiar from earlier sections of this book):
              •  Taking excerpts of a larger work. Read the relevant FAQ at https:// 
               creativecommons.org/faq/#can-i-reuse-an-excerpt-of-a-larger-work 
                -that-is-licensed-with-the-noderivs-restriction.
              •  Using a work in a different format. Read the relevant FAQ at https:// 
               creativecommons.org/faq/#can-i-take-a-cc-licensed-work-and-use-it 
                -in-a-different-format  .
              •  Modifying a work. Read the relevant FAQ at https://creativecommons 
               .org/faq/#when-is-my-use-considered-an-adaptation.

        Fundamental principle
          As of Version 4.0, all CC licenses, even the NoDerivatives licenses, allow anyone to make an
          adaptation of a CC-licensed work. The difference between ND licenses and the other licenses
          is that if an adaptation of an ND-licensed work has been created, it cannot be shared with
          others. So an individual can create adaptations of an ND-licensed work, but he/she is not
          allowed to share these with others, including the learners at an educational institution.

                                USiNG CC LicENSES AND CC-LicENSED WORKS - 81 -

                If your reuse of a CC-licensed work does not create an adaptation, then
                  •  you are not required to apply a ShareAlike-license to your overall work
                   if you are using an SA-licensed work within it;
                  •  the ND restriction does not prevent you from using an ND-licensed
                work; and
                  •  you can combine that CC-licensed material with other work as long as you
                  attribute and comply with the NonCommercial restriction if it applies.
                If your reuse of a CC-licensed work does create an adaptation, then there are
            limits on whether and how you may share the adapted work. We will look at
              those next. But first, a note about collections of materials.
          ADAPTATIONS AND REMIXES VS. COLLECTIONS
             Introductory note: The distinction between adaptations and collections is one
             of the trickiest concepts in copyright law. While there are many situations in
            which the differences are clear, there are also several ambiguous scenarios.
            The distinction between adaptations and remixes is even less clear; it varies
             by jurisdiction, and even within a given jurisdiction, a judge’s determination
             between the two can be subjective, since there are few definitive rules on which
              to rely.
               In contrast to an adaptation or remix, a collection involves the assembly of
            separate and independent creative works into a collective whole. A collection
              is not an adaptation. One community member likened the difference between
             adaptations and collections to smoothies and TV dinners, respectively:
                 1. Like a smoothie (figure 4.9), an adaptation or remix mixes material from
                   different sources to create a wholly new work.
                       In an adaptation or remix (and a smoothie), you often cannot tell where
                   one constituent work ends and another one begins. While this flexibility
                    is useful for the new creator, it is still important to provide attribution to
                   the individual parts that went into making the adaptation.
                     An example of an educational adaptation would be an open textbook
                   chapter that weaves together multiple OER in such a way that the reader
                   can’t tell which resource was used on which page. That said, the endnotes
                    of the book chapter should still provide attribution to all of the sources
                   that were remixed in the chapter.

               2. Like a TV dinner (figure 4.10), a collection groups different works
                 together; however, a collection keeps them organized as distinct and separate
                 objects. An example of a collection would be a book that consists of
                 a group of essays from different sources, or by different authors.
            When you create a collection, you must provide attribution and
                licensing information about each of the individual works in that collection.
                This gives the public the information they need to understand who
                created what and which license terms apply to specific content. You can
                revisit section 4.1 “Choosing and Applying a CC License” to learn how
                to properly indicate the copyright status of third-party works that you
               incorporate into your new work.
                   When you combine material into a collection, you may have a separate 
               copyright of your own that you may license. However, your copyright

                  only extends to the new contributions that you made to the work. In a
                   collection, this is the selection and arrangement of the various works in
                  the collection, and not the individual works themselves. For example,
                   you can select and arrange pre-existing poems published by others into
                   an anthology, write an introduction, and design a cover for the collection
                   , but your copyright and the only copyright you can license extends
                  to your arrangement of the poems (not the poems themselves), and your
                   original introduction and cover. The poems are not yours to license.
         WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU CREATE AN ADAPTATION
          OF A CC-LICENSED WORK OR WORKS? 
            General rules
                  •  If the underlying work is licensed under a NoDerivatives license, you can
                 make and use changes privately, but you cannot share your adaptation
                  with others, as discussed above.
                  •  If the underlying or original work is licensed under a ShareAlike license, then
                   ShareAlike applies to your adaptation of it, and you must license the adaptation
                   under the same or a compatible license. There is more on this below.
                  •  You need to consider license compatibility. License compatibility is the
                 term used to address the issue of which types of licensed works can be
                 adapted into a new work.
                  •  In all cases, you have to attribute the original work when you create an
                  adaptation.
           Scenarios
            When creating an adaptation of a CC-licensed work, the simplest scenario is
             when you take a single CC-licensed work and adapt it.
              The more complicated scenario is when you are adapting two or more CC- 
            licensed works into a new work.
               In both situations, you need to consider what options you have for licensing
             the copyright you have in your adaptation; this is called the Adapter’s License. 
            Remember that your rights in your adaptation only apply to your own contributions.
             The original license continues to govern the reuse of the elements from
            the original work that you used when creating your adaptation. The “CC Adapters
             License Chart,” shown in figure 4.11, may be a helpful guide. When creating
             an adaptation of material under the license identified in the left-hand column,
             you may license your contributions to the adaptation under one of the licenses
            indicated on the top row if the corresponding box is dark gray. Creative Com-

         mons does not recommend using a license if the corresponding box is white,
          although doing so is technically permitted by the terms of the license. If you do,
         you should take additional care to mark the adaptation as involving multiple
          copyrights under different terms, so that downstream users are aware of their
          obligations to comply with the licenses from all rights holders. The light gray
          boxes indicate those licenses that you may not use as your adapter’s license.
        HOW TO PICK YOUR ADAPTER’S LICENSE
         If the underlying work is licensed with BY or BY-NC, we recommend that your
         adapter’s license include at least the same license elements as the license
          applied to the original. For example, if one adapts a BY-NC work, she will apply
          BY-NC to her adaptation. If one adapts a BY work, she could apply either BY or
          BY-NC to her adaptation.
            If the underlying work is licensed with BY-SA or BY-NC-SA, your adapter’s
          license must be the same license applied to the original or a license that is designated
          as compatible to the original license. We’ll discuss license compatibility
          in more detail below.
            Remember, if the underlying work is licensed with BY-ND or BY-NC-ND, you
         cannot distribute adaptations, so you don’t need to be concerned about what
          adapter’s license to apply.

          UNDERSTANDING LICENSE COMPATIBILITY
            When people talk about licenses being “compatible,” they can be referring to
             several different situations.
               One type of license compatibility involves the question of what licenses you
             can use for your adapter’s license when you adapt a work. This is what we discussed
            above. For example, BY-NC is compatible with BY, in the sense that one
            can adapt a BY work and use BY-NC on her adaptation.
                By definition, the ShareAlike licenses have very few compatible licenses. All
             SA licenses after Version 1.0 allow you to use a later version of the same license
            on your adaptation. For example, if you remix a BY-SA 2.0 work, you can, and
            should, apply BY-SA 4.0 to your adaptation. There are also a small number of
             non-CC licenses that have been designated as CC Compatible Licenses for Share- 
            Alike purposes. You can read more about this at https://creativecommons.org/
            share-your-work/licensing-considerations/compatible-licenses.
                Another type of license compatibility relates to what licenses are compatible
            when adapting (more commonly referred to as “remixing” in this context) more
            than one pre-existing work. The remix chart in figure 4.12 may be a helpful
             guide in these circumstances. To use the chart, find a license that applies to one
             of the works on the left-hand column and the license that applies to the other








              FIGURE 4.12 CC License Compatibility Chart

          work on the top right row. If there is a checkmark in the box where that row and
          column intersect, then the works under those two licenses can be remixed. If
          there is an “X” in the box, then the works may not be remixed unless an exception
          or limitation applies.
            When using the chart, you can determine which license to use for your adaptation
          by choosing the more restrictive of the two licenses on the works you’re
         combining. While this technically isn’t your only option for your adapter’s
          license, it is best practice because it eases reuse for downstream users.
       Final Remarks
         It can be intimidating to approach remixing in a way that is consistent with
          copyright. In this section, hopefully you gained some tools for how to approach

        Additional Details on the Court Cases in Section 4.2 
        “Things to Consider after CC Licensing”
          In the FedEx Office case, the decision was affirmed by the U.S. 2nd Circuit Court
         of Appeals, which stated: “In sum, the unambiguous terms of License permit
          FedEx to copy the Materials on behalf of a school district exercising rights under
          the License and charge that district for that copying at a rate more than FedEx’s
          cost, in the absence of any claim that the school district is using the Materials
          for other than a ‘non-Commercial purpose.’ The motion to dismiss is granted.”
             With the Office Depot case, Great Minds claimed that the copy store had violated
          the BY-NC-SA 4.0 license for the same reasons FedEx Office did; however,
         Great Minds also claimed that because Office Depot had reached out to school
          districts to solicit reproduction orders, the solicitation was additional evidence
          of a license violation. The other difference with the FedEx Office   case was that
          Great Minds and Office Depot had entered into a contract specifying that Office
         Depot could reproduce the same publicly funded educational materials for
          school districts and would pay royalties to Great Minds.5 
            The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California agreed with
          Office Depot, stating that it “concludes that the Creative Commons Public
         License unambiguously grants the licensee schools and school districts the

            right ‘to reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part, for
            NonCommercial purposes only,’ and does not prohibit the schools and school
             districts from employing third parties, such as Office Depot, to make copies of
             the Materials. . . . Because the schools and school districts are the entities exercising
             the rights granted under the Creative Commons Public License, it is irrelevant
            that Office Depot may have profited from making copies for schools and
              school districts.”
             Furthermore, the district court stated: “The Creative Commons Public
             License at issue authorizes schools to: (1) reproduce and use the Materials for
            NonCommercial purposes, (2) expressly permits the schools to provide those
             Materials to the public ‘by any means or process,’ and (3) does not prohibit the
             schools from outsourcing the copying to third-party vendors. Because a licensee
             may lawfully use a third-party agent or contractor to assist it in exercising its
             licensed rights, absent contractual provisions prohibiting such activity, Great
             Minds has failed to allege that Office Depot’s conduct was outside the scope of
            the license and, thus, Great Minds’ claim for copyright infringement against
             Office Depot fails.” The court also addressed Office Depot’s alleged solicitation
             of school districts’ reproduction business. The court did not find the difference
            urged by Great Minds persuasive or that it should change the outcome. The
             Office Depot case remains pending on appeal before the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of
            Appeals as of August 15, 2019. Oral argument appears likely in November 2019,
             and a decision will follow.

          NOTES
                 1. One of Creative Commons’ roles is to serve as a responsible public license steward
                    , actively providing guidance and education about its licenses. When Creative
                   Commons considers weighing in on disputes with commentary or the filing of
                    friend-of-the-court briefs, CC always acts as an advocate for the licenses and their
                    proper interpretation, never in favor of or against a particular litigant. For a
                    detailed analysis of Creative Commons case law, see section 3.4 “License Enforceability.”
                    Creative Commons maintains a database of court decisions and case law
                    from jurisdictions around the world on the Creative Commons wiki for Case
                    Law (licensed CC BY 4.0, available at https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/
                   Case_Law).
                 2. The official names of the court cases are: “Great Minds v. FedEx Office and Print
                    Services, Inc., U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York (Civil
                    Action 2:16-cv-01462-DRH-ARL)” and “Great Minds vs. Office Depot, Inc., U.S.
                    District Court for the Central District of California (CV 17-7435-JFW).”
                 3. The official name of the court case is “Larry Philpot v Media Research Center Inc.,
                    U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, Case 1:17-cv-822.”

                    how CC licenses use those terms.
                 5. According to the complaint, this contract was entered into while FedEx Office
                    was pending. However, once the district court granted the motion to dismiss
                    in favor of FedEx Office, Office Depot terminated its contract with Great Minds
                    shortly before it expired and, in reliance on the FedEx Office decision, continued
                    to reproduce Great Minds’ materials for school districts without paying royalties
                    to Great Minds.

          AS THE ROLE OF LIBRARIES EVOLVES AND EXPANDS IN OUR FAST-CHANGING
            information environment, expertise in open licensing has become a crucial
             asset for the modern librarian.
               Creative Commons powers the open education movement with tools that help
            create better, more flexible, and more sustainable open educational resources
            (OER), practices, and policies. Creative Commons licenses are the most popular
            open licenses in open education and Open Access (OA) projects around the
            world; CC puts the “open” in OER and OA. This chapter will introduce you to

        5.1 | OPEN ACCESS TO SCHOLARSHIP
         What is Open Access scholarly literature? Open Access literature is digital,
          online, free of charge, and free of most copyright and licensing restrictions.
         Open Access stands in contrast to the existing “closed” system for communicating
          scientific and scholarly research. This system is slow, expensive, and
          ill-suited for research collaboration and discovery. And even though scholarly
          research is largely produced as a result of public funding, the results are often
          hidden behind technical, legal, and financial barriers or paywalls. Open Access
         publishing is an alternative model—one that takes full advantage of digital 
          technologies, the web, and open licensing to provide free access to scholarship.
       LEARNING OUTCOMES
              •  Define Open Access
              •  Explain the benefits of Open Access for your learners and for 
               researchers at your institution
              •  Understand how authors and researchers can make their own 
              works Open Access
        THE BIG QUESTION: WHY IT MATTERS
          The purpose of scientific inquiry at a university is the fundamental search for
          knowledge. Teaching, the open exchange of ideas, and the process of publishing
          original research are all methods by which academic faculty, learners, staff, and
          others contribute to advancing scholarship.
            How well do the current practices of accessing and sharing information
          within the university system reflect and support the stated goals of research
         and scholarship?
             This chapter will explore how the practice of Open Access publishing aligns
         with the goals of improving access to knowledge, and how librarians can 
         support colleges and universities in implementing Open Access practices and 
          policies.

          PERSONAL REFLECTION: WHY IT MATTERS TO YOU
            How does your institution support (or not support) the open publication of
            research? How do you interact with learners and faculty who are searching for
            academic research? Have you ever encountered a paywall while trying to access
             research articles?
         Acquiring Essential Knowledge
          SCHOLARLY PUBLISHING TODAY
             To get an overview of the topic, you should first read the Wikipedia article on
            “Scholarly Communication” (licensed CC BY-SA 3.0 and available at https://
            en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholarly_communication). This article defines scholarly
            communication as “the system through which research and other scholarly
             writings are created, evaluated for quality, disseminated to the scholarly community
            , and preserved for future use. The system includes both formal means
            of communication, such as publication in peer-reviewed journals, and informal
             channels, such as electronic listservs.”

          institutions seek funds to conduct a variety of research. Most often this funding
          comes from government sources (e.g., the National Institutes of Health in
          the United States), although there are several philanthropic foundations (such
          as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation) that are now making major investments
          in particular types of research.
            After the researchers have secured their grants, they conduct their experiments
          and collect their data. Most of the time these researchers prepare their
          results in the form of an academic article, which they then submit to a scholarly
         journal for publication. The journals then arrange for some of the submitted
          articles to undergo a process of peer review, in which experts within that particular
          topic or field will read, review, and usually provide comments on the
         submitted paper.
             Some of the articles that pass the peer review stage are then offered for publication
          in the journal. The journal will notify the author that her paper has been
          accepted, and usually require that the author transfer copyright in the article
          to (or agree to an exclusive publishing contract with) the journal. By accepting
          these terms, the author has granted to the journal her exclusive rights under
         copyright. This means that the journal—and not the author—is now the copyright
          holder of the article, and so the journal may restrict the terms of access
          and reuse provided for by the bundle of rights granted to rights holders under
          the law.
            Because journals have become the de facto rights holders to the articles in
          which new scientific research is published, they are also in a position to license
          access to these materials to university libraries, research institutions, and the
          public—typically for a significant fee. This leads to a cyclical situation in which
          for-profit publishers essentially sell back access to the scientific and scholarly
          record that academics originally produced through public grants.
            Even after a publishing embargo (usually a time of six months to a year,
          during which the publishers retain exclusive publishing rights) expires, access
          to the mostly publicly funded scientific research remains limited, with users
          only permitted to read those articles if they are properly submitted to institutional
          repositories. In the end, the public is left with restricted access to the publicly
          funded scholarly record, and progress in the scientific enterprise doesn’t
         reach its maximum potential.
          There are several critiques of the existing academic publishing system.

             CC BY 4.0, available at https://sparcopen.org/open-access/), some highlights of
            which are given below:
                  •  Governments provide most of the funding for research—many billions
                  of dollars annually—and public institutions employ a large portion of all
                 researchers.
                  •  Researchers publish their findings without the expectation of compensation.
                  Unlike other authors, they hand their work over to publishers without
                 payment, in the interest of advancing human knowledge.
                  •  Through the process of peer review, researchers review each other’s
                  work for free.
                  •  Once published, those that contributed to the research (from taxpayers to
                  the institutions that supported the research itself) have to pay again to
                   access the findings. Though research is produced as a public good, it isn’t
                   available to the public who paid for it. (2007-2017 SPARC, CC BY)
               As ever-increasing journal prices outpace library budgets, academic libraries
             are forced to make difficult decisions—often having to cancel subscriptions
            or shift money away from other budget items. According to the Association
             of Research Libraries (ARL), the average cost of a serial subscription for ARL
             member libraries increased by 315 percent from 1986 to 2003.1 Since 2003, average
            journal prices have increased more slowly, but they’ve still continued to
             rise about nine percent each year.
          OPEN ACCESS PUBLISHING
            The “closed access” publishing system limits the impact of the research produced
             by the scientific and scholarly community and progress is thereby slowed
             significantly. By contrast, Open Access literature is defined  by the scholar Peter
             Suber as “digital, online, free of charge, and free of most copyright and licensing
             restrictions.”2 The graphic in figure 5.2 provides a quick overview of how an
            open-access publishing system works.
                In contrast to figure 5.1, which explained the current costly and inefficient
             science publishing life cycle, figure 5.2 explores an alternate path—the open
             access route.
               The process begins just as it did in the explanation of the incumbent system
            —with government requests for proposals (RFPs) for research. But instead
             of remaining silent on how the research results will be communicated, the RFPs

            Next, researchers conduct their scientific experiments and prepare their
          academic manuscripts. When they go to submit their articles to journals, they
         must think about the Open-Access policy requirements they agreed upon when
          they accepted their grant funding. This means that the researchers must retain
          their copyrights—and not sign them over to for-profit publishers. Or instead,
          authors must search out a “Gold” open access journal, which publishes research
          under liberal open-access licenses (like CC BY) at publication. In either case,
          authors retain some—or all—rights to their research articles, permitting them
          to publish under open access licenses, and ensuring that they may deposit their
          articles in a university or institutional repository for long-term access and
         preservation.
            By publishing under open access licenses like CC BY, downstream users are
          granted the legal permissions to access and reuse the research. This type of

            open access system is better aligned with the original purpose of conducting
             science and sharing results openly through the scholarly publishing process. In
             the long run, the open access approach is more efficient, equitable, affordable,
             and collaborative.
          OPEN ACCESS OPTIONS
            Open Access authors have the opportunity to publish in a few ways. The most
            common are known as “Green” and “Gold” Open Access.
              Green OA involves making a version of the article or manuscript freely
             available in a repository. This is also known as self-archiving. An example of
             Green OA is a university research repository. OA repositories can be organized
             by discipline (e.g., arXiv for physics) or institution (e.g., Knowledge@UChicago
             for the University of Chicago).
               Gold OA involves making the final version of the manuscript freely available
             immediately upon publication by the publisher, typically by publishing it in an
            Open Access journal and making the article available under an open license.
            Typically, Open Access journals charge an article processing charge (APC)
            when an author wishes to (1) publish an article online allowing for free public
             access and (2) retain the copyright to the article. APCs range from zero to
            several thousand dollars per article. You can read more about APCs on Wikipe-
             dia’s “Article Processing Charge” (licensed CC BY-SA 3.0 and available at https://
             en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_processing_charge). An example of a Gold OA jour-
             nal is PLOS Biology, one of several scientific journals put out by the nonprofit
             publisher PLOS (Public Library of Science).
                The Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ; https://doaj.org/) is a site that
            indexes open access journals, and HowOpenIsIt? (licensed CC BY 4.0, available
             at https://sparcopen.org/our-work/howopenisit/) is a handy tool for evaluating
             the relative “openness” of journals from fully open-access to closed-access.
                Certain emerging models like preprints and hubs are rapidly emerging, and
            they can provide a new way of considering Open Access publishing outside of
            the constraints of publisher-mediated models.
          Educating Authors about Their Publishing Rights
          By understanding copyright and the various scholarly publishing options,
            librarians can help faculty members and graduate learners navigate the system
             as they publish research.

[Link]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altmetrics
          - 98 - CHAPTER 5

             Often, scholarly publishers require authors to transfer their rights to publishing
          companies before their research will be published in an academic journal.
         Academic librarians and other library departments can support faculty
         and student authors by helping them understand what they give up when they
          transfer their copyrights to a publisher. For example, scholarly authors who
          transfer copyright could lose the ability to post their research on their own
          websites.
             Several tools exist to help faculty and scholars understand their rights and
          publishing options, and to help them exercise those rights. The Termination of
          Transfer tool,3 co-stewarded by the Authors Alliance and Creative Commons,
         gives authors who have previously entered into publishing agreements information
          about whether and how they can regain the publication rights that they
         previously assigned away so they can publish on new terms, including under
         a CC license if they choose. The Scholars Copyright Addendum Engine4 can be
         used by faculty and other authors to amend publication agreements when they
          are submitting an article to a traditional publisher. The engine allows authors to
          choose among different options to reserve rights for themselves and generates
          an agreement that is then submitted with a traditional publication agreement to
          make that legally effective. Additionally, the Authors Alliance publishes myriad
          resources about these tools and open access, and PLOS offers resources and
          articles about the benefits of open access as well.
            Academic librarians can also help scholars understand how different publishing
         options affect both the audience and the prestige of their work. The
          “impact factor” is a primary metric of the prominence of a journal or publication
          , measured by the number of times the average article in a particular journal
          has been cited (in other sources) in one year. Because impact factors are not
          necessarily a reliable metric of a journal’s importance, some publishers like
         Nature Research, the publisher of the prestigious scientific journal Nature, 
         are reconsidering the importance of impact factors for journals. Many Open
         Access scholars encourage systems like altmetrics to provide another way of
          thinking about impact beyond the traditional metrics. In 2017, Science released
          a study finding that on average, open access papers had a fifty percent higher
          research impact than strictly “paywalled” papers.5 For more information, read
          Jon Tennant’s 2016 article (https://f1000research.com/articles/5-632/v1) on the
          academic, societal, and economic advantages of open access.

          Open Access Practices and Policies 
          at the University and Beyond
            An open access policy is a formal policy adopted by an institution to support
             researchers in making their work openly available. These policies can refer to
            published peer-reviewed articles, conference papers, and peer-reviewed drafts
             or pre-printed publications that are deposited in an institutional repository or
            published under open-access terms in a journal. Open access policies generally
            define the guidelines for how researchers can disseminate their research
            in order to maximize access to them. The Registry of Open Access Repository 
          Mandates and Policies (ROARMAP; https://roarmap.eprints.org) is a registry
            that charts the open access policies or mandates adopted by universities,
           research institutions, and research funders that require or request their
            researchers to provide open access to their peer-reviewed research article
             output by depositing it in an institutional repository, or publish their research
            under open-access terms in a journal.
               According to Peter Suber, an open access advocate, mandate is not the best
             word “‘for open-access policies,’ . . . but neither is any other English word.”6 
            Without a mandate, institutions can consider faculty opt-in policies, whereby
             libraries or copyright offices focus on shifting the default publishing practice
             to open access.
          UNIVERSITY POLICIES
            Many universities have adopted open access policies that require universityaffiliated
             researchers to grant to their institution a non-exclusive license to
             a scholarly article at the time of the creation of the work. This process heads
            off problems with publishers downstream, since the university retains a legal
             right to the work before copyright is transferred to a publisher. These policies
            have proliferated under the assumption that universities themselves should
            be able to access and preserve the research outputs of their faculty. To view
             an example, review the University of California Open Access Policy at https://
            osc.universityofcalifornia.edu/open-access-policy/. You can also view many
             other institutions’ open-access policies on the ROARMAP site (https://roarmap.
             eprints.org), which has collected several hundred of these policies, including
            those of universities, colleges, research organizations, and other academic
             institutions.
              For academic librarians who are interested in developing an open access
             policy for their university or institution, the Harvard Open Access Project has

[Link]
https://publicaccess.nih.gov/
          - 100 - CHAPTER 5

          developed a toolkit, licensed CC BY 3.0 and available at https://cyber.harvard.
          edu/hoap/Good_practices_for_university_open-access_policies. Open Access policies
         usually originate from an institution’s Office of Scholarly Communications
          , but librarians in a variety of roles (outreach, reference, etc.) can also help
          craft these policies.
        PUBLIC POLICY
          In addition to encouraging the development of open access policies at the university
          level, public policies can ensure that publicly funded research be made
          available under Open Access terms. This typically is accomplished through the
         inclusion of sharing requirements that are tied to receiving government or
         philanthropic grant funds. When funding cycles for research include deposit
          or open license requirements for publications, the resulting increased access
         and opportunities for reuse extend the value of that research funding. As
          an example, the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) Public Access Policy 
          requires that “all investigators funded by the NIH submit or have submitted for
          them to the National Library of Medicine’s PubMed Central an electronic version
          of their final, peer-reviewed manuscripts upon acceptance for publication,
          to be made publicly available no later than twelve months after the official date
          of publication.”7
            The Fair Access to Science and Technology Research Act (FASTR) was introduced
          repeatedly in both houses of Congress in the period from 2012 to 2017, but
          it has yet to be approved. Should U.S. Congress approve FASTR, the bill would
          require federal agencies with annual extramural research budgets of $100 million
          or more to provide the public with online access to the research articles
          stemming from that funded research within six to twelve months after publication
          in a peer-reviewed journal. The passage of FASTR would ensure that articles
          based on publicly funded research are made freely available for all potential
          users to read, and it would ensure that those articles can be fully used in the
          digital environment, enabling the use of new computational analysis tools that
          promise to revolutionize the research process.
       Open Access Myths Debunked
          For faculty and learners alike, open access can seem like a scary new world, particularly
          since the pressure to publish has increased. There are many guides to
          debunking the myths of open access publishing, and reading these carefully to
          dispel any fear or misunderstanding is crucial in the current academic landscape.

         Final Remarks
            Universities play a major role in advancing scientific research, and academic
             publishing is a key mechanism for faculty to communicate their findings to colleagues
             and the public. As organizers of knowledge within institutions, librarians
             can work together with university researchers to promote access to information.
            They can do this by educating on the “how” and “why” of open access,
            answering questions about copyright, and providing guidance and recommendations
             to maximize the reach and impact of scholarly publishing in particular
              fields.

          THE BIG QUESTION: WHY IT MATTERS
           Do you remember when smartphones were first released? They were full of
             infinite possibilities compared to earlier phones. Before smartphones, we could
             only call and text. But with smartphones, we can now take videos and pictures,
             play movies and music, surf the web and read e-mail, and call and text. It was
             difficult for long-time users of older phones to take advantage of all the capabilities
             offered by the new phones. They were too accustomed to the limitations of
            older phones. For months—and sometimes years—they used their smartphones
             only to call and text. (Maybe you know someone like this?)

          - 102 - CHAPTER 5

            Many educators have the same problem with open educational resources.
         They have spent so much time using education materials published under
          restrictive licenses that they struggle to take advantage of the new pedagogical
          capabilities offered by OER. These pedagogical capabilities are all about the
         teaching and learning practices and tools that empower learners and teachers
          to create and share knowledge openly and learn deeply.
        Three Definitions
         The Open Education movement is still discussing and debating what it means
          to think about teaching and learning practices in a more inclusive, diverse, and
         open manner. You can read a few examples of how various educators approach
          this topic on the Year of Open (licensed CC BY 4.0, available at https://www.year 
         ofopen.org/april-open-perspective-what-is-open-pedagogy/). At least three 
         fun­damental terms have emerged from this discussion:
              •  Open Educational Practices (from Cronin’s 2018 Open Edu Global presen-
                tation): the use, reuse, or creation of OER and collaborative, pedagogical
               practices employing social and participatory technologies for interaction
               , peer-learning, knowledge creation and sharing, and the empowerment
               of learners.
              •  Open Pedagogy (from DeRosa and Jhangiani’s chapter in the 2017 book, A
               Guide to Making Open Textbooks with Students): an access-oriented com-
               mitment to learner-driven education and a process of designing architectures
               and using tools for learning that enable learners to shape the
              public knowledge commons of which they are a part. (There is more on
                this at Open Pedagogy Notebook, licensed CC BY 4.0 and available at http://
              openpedagogy.org/open-pedagogy.)
              •  OER-Enabled Pedagogy (from Wiley and Hilton’s 2018 journal article 
               “Defining OER-Enabled Pedagogy”): a set of teaching and learning practices
                that are only possible or practical when you have permission to engage
                in the 5R activities [i.e., retain, reuse, revise, remix, and redistribute].
        Personal Reflection: Why It Matters to You
         When you’ve used open educational resources in the past, have you taken
          advantage of the permissions offered by their open licenses, or did you use OER
          just like you used your previous, traditionally copyrighted materials? In other
          words, did you do anything with the OER that was impossible to do with traditionally
         copyrighted materials? Why or why not?

         Acquiring Essential Knowledge
              It’s well-established that people learn through activities. And it’s equally
            well-established that copyright restricts people from engaging in a range of
             activities. When juxtaposed like this, it becomes clear that copyright restricts
            pedagogy by contracting the universe of things that learners and teachers can
             do with education materials. If there are things that learners are not allowed to
             do, this means there are ways that learners are not allowed to learn. If there are
             things that teachers aren’t allowed to do, this means there are ways that teachers
             aren’t allowed to teach.
               You can learn about how these restrictions on what teachers and learners
            can do impacts teaching and learning by reading the metaphor/blog post about
            driving airplanes on roads at https://opencontent.org/blog/archives/3761.
          Examples of Open Educational Practices, 
         Open Pedagogy, and OER-Enabled Pedagogy
             One of the foundational ideas of open teaching and learning practices is the distinction
            between disposable and renewable assignments.
               Do you remember doing homework for school that felt utterly pointless? A
             “disposable assignment” is an assignment that supports an individual student’s
            learning but adds no other value to the world—the student spends hours working
             on it, the teacher spends time grading it, and the student gets it back and
            then throws it away. While disposable assignments may promote learning by
            an individual student, these assignments can be demoralizing for people who
            want to feel like their work matters beyond the immediate moment.
                In contrast, “renewable assignments” are assignments that both support
            individual student learning and add value to the broader world. With renewable
             assignments, learners are asked to create and openly license valuable artifacts
             that, in addition to supporting their own learning, will be useful to other
            learners both inside and outside the classroom. Classic renewable assignments
             include, for example, collaborating with learners to write new case studies for
            textbooks, creating “explainer” videos, and modifying learning materials that
             will speak more directly to learners’ local cultures and needs.
               To explore additional examples of this pedagogical approach in action, check
            out the examples given by David Wiley in Project Management for Instructional
             Designers (licensed CC BY-NC-SA 4.0, available at http://pm4id.org/) and

          rials to create new textbooks. In both of these cases, teachers had learners create
         their own textbooks, which then had Creative Commons licenses applied
         to them. Other examples of OER-enabled pedagogy in action include assignments
         by JB Murray (licensed CC BY-SA 3.0 on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ 
        Wikipedia:WikiProject_Murder_Madness_and_Mayhem) and Amin Azzam
          (licensed CC BY-SA 3.0 on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject 
          _Medicine/UCSF_Elective_2013) that had learners significantly improve articles
         that were in Wikipedia. When they completed these assignments, the learners
          had created open artifacts that were useful in both supporting their own learning
          and the learning of other learners and educators. In these examples, learners
          created assignments that allowed them to interact with the greater community
          and ensured that the assignments are renewable, not disposable, artifacts.
            A couple of other interesting examples of renewable assignments are a
          remixed explainer video that a student made, entitled Blogs and Wikis: a fictitious
         debate (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsFU3sAlPx4) and the DS106
         assignment bank (http://assignments.ds106.us/) which is a hub for studentcreated
         , CC-licensed content. Additional examples are available on the Open
         Pedagogy Notebook website (licensed CC BY 4.0 and available at http://open

       Final Remarks
         If you’re just going to use your new smartphone the same way you used your
          old flip phone, there wasn’t much point in getting a new phone. Likewise, when
         we use OER to support learning in exactly the same ways that we used the old
          “all rights reserved” materials, we may save learners money, but we miss out on
         the transformative power of open pedagogy. As you prepare to use OER in your
          teaching, think about the new things that are possible in the context of permission
          to engage in the 5R activities.
        5.3 | OER, OPEN TEXTBOOKS, OPEN COURSES
          Open Education is an idea, as well as a set of content, practices, policies, and
         communities which, when properly leveraged, can help everyone in the world
          access free, effective, open learning materials at either zero or marginal cost. 
          We live in an age of information abundance where everyone, for the first time
          in human history, can potentially attain all the education they desire. The key
          to this transformational shift in learning is Open Educational Resources (OER).

                       CREATiVE COMMONS FOR LiBRARiANS AND EDucATORS - 105 -

             OER are educational materials that are shared at no cost, with legal permissions
             for the public to freely use, share, and build upon their content.
               OER are possible because:
                  •  they are (mostly) born digital,8 and digital resources can be stored, 
                   copied, and distributed for near zero cost;
                  •  the Internet makes it simple for the public to share digital content; and
                  •  Creative Commons licenses make it simple and legal to retain copyright
                  and legally share educational resources with the world.
               Because we can share effective education materials with the world for near
            zero cost,9 many people argue that educators and governments which support
             public education have a moral and ethical obligation to do so. After all, education
            is fundamentally about sharing knowledge and ideas. Creative Commons
             believes that OER will replace much of the expensive, proprietary content that
             is currently used in academic courses. Shifting to this open model will generate
             more equitable economic opportunities and social benefits globally without
             sacrificing the quality of educational content.
          THE BIG QUESTION: WHY IT MATTERS
             Does it seem reasonable that education in the age of the Internet should be more
            expensive and less flexible than it was in previous generations? Education is
            more important than ever before; nothing else can do as much to promote the
            happiness, prosperity, and security of individuals, families, and societies.
            While many interesting and useful experiments are occurring outside formal
            education, the degrees, certificates, and other credentials awarded by formal
             institutions are still critically important to the quality of life of many people
            around the world.
               Formal education, even in the age of the Internet, can be more expensive and
             less flexible than ever. In many countries, the publishers of educational materials
             overcharge for textbooks and other resources. As part of their transition
            from print to digital, these same companies have largely moved away from a
            model where learners purchase and own books to a “streaming” model where
             they have access to those resources for only a limited time. Furthermore, publishers
             are constantly developing new restrictive technologies that limit what
            learners and faculty can do with the resources they have temporary access to,
            including novel ways to prohibit printing, prevent cutting and pasting, and
             restrict the sharing of materials between friends.

          - 106 - CHAPTER 5

       LEARNING OUTCOMES
               •    Define the word open in the context of open educational resources
               •    Differentiate between OER, open textbooks, open courses, and MOOCs
                  (massive open online courses)
        PERSONAL REFLECTION: WHY IT MATTERS TO YOU
         What impacts have the rising costs and decreased flexibility of educational
         materials had on you and those you know? What role do you think that “all
          rights reserved” copyrights and related laws have played in driving up costs
          and driving down flexibility for learners and teachers?
       Acquiring Essential Knowledge
          Open Educational Resources are teaching, learning, and research materials in
         any medium that reside in the public domain or have been released under an
          open license that permits no-cost access, use, adaptation, and redistribution by
          others.10 Or we could use this less technical definition to describe OER: OER are
          educational materials that can be freely downloaded, edited, and shared to better
          serve all students.11
                OER and Open Textbooks
                    To begin, you should watch the video Why OER? 
                   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qc2ovlU9Ndk | CC BY 3.0

             In contrast to traditional educational materials, which are constantly becoming
          more expensive and less flexible, OER give everyone, everywhere, free permission
         to download, edit, and share them with others. David Wiley provides
          another popular definition, stating that only educational materials licensed in
          a manner that provides the public with permission to engage in the 5R activities
         can be considered OER.
            The 5R permissions are:
              1. Retain—permission to make, own, and control copies of the content (e.g.,
                download, duplicate, store, and manage it)
              2. Reuse—permission to use the content in a wide range of ways (e.g., in a
                  class, in a study group, on a website, in a video)
              3. Revise—permission to adapt, adjust, modify, or alter the content itself
                 (e.g., translate the content into another language)

                4. Remix—permission to combine the original or revised content with
                   other material to create something new (e.g., incorporate the content
                  into a mashup)
                 5. Redistribute—permission to share copies of the original content, your
                    revisions, or your remixes with others (e.g., give a copy to a friend)
                The easiest way to confirm that an educational resource is an “open” one that
             provides you with the 5R permissions is to determine that the resource is either
            in the public domain or has been licensed under a Creative Commons license
            which permits the creation of derivative works; these licenses are CC BY, CC
            BY-SA, CC BY-NC, and CC BY-NC-SA.
              Open educational resources come in all shapes and sizes. An OER can be
             as small as a single article, academic paper, video, or simulation, or it can be
             as large as an entire degree program. However, it can be difficult, or at least
            time-consuming for teachers to assemble OER into a collection that is comprehensive
            enough to replace an “all rights reserved” copyrighted textbook. When
            OER are collected and presented in ways that resemble a traditional textbook,
             it often makes it easier for teachers to use the resources. The term open textbook
            simply means a collection of OER that has been organized to look like a
             traditional textbook in order to ease the adoption process. To see examples of
             open textbooks in a number of disciplines, visit OpenStax (licensed CC BY 4.0,
             available at http://openstaxcollege.org/), the Open Textbook Library (licensed
            CC BY 4.0, available at https://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks/), or the BC Open
            Textbook Project (licensed CC BY 4.0, available at https://open.bccampus.ca/).
            Other times, OER are aggregated and presented as digital courseware. To see
            examples of open courseware, visit the Open Education Consortium (licensed
            CC BY 4.0, available at http://www.oeconsortium.org/courses/) and MIT Open-
            CourseWare (licensed CC BY-NC-SA 4.0, available at https://ocw.mit.edu/index 
             .htm).
               In addition to demonstrating that learners save money when their teachers
            adopt OER, research shows that learners can have better outcomes when their
            teachers choose OER instead of educational materials that are available under
             “all rights reserved” copyright.
                The use of OER is strongly advocated by a broad range of individuals, organizations
            , and governments, as evidenced by documents like the Cape Town Open
            Education Declaration (2007), the UNESCO Paris OER Declaration (2012), and
            the recently adopted UNESCO Ljubljana OER Action Plan (2017).

        OER vs. Free Library Resources
         Teachers and professors typically use a mix of “all rights reserved” commercial
          content, free library resources, and OER in their courses. While the library
          resources are “free” to the learners and faculty at that institution, they are (1)
          not really “free” because the institution’s library had to pay to purchase or subscribe
          to them, and (2) they are not available to the general public. The chart in
          figure 5.3 describes the cost to learners and the legal permissions available to
          teachers and learners for each of these types of educational resources.
        OER in Primary and Secondary (K−12) Education vs. Tertiary
       (Higher) Education
          Open educational resources are used in all sectors of education. How OER are
          produced and adopted, however, often differs depending on the level of education
          in which they are used.
             In general, tertiary (higher education) faculty members are more likely to:
              •  have the time, resources, and support to produce and revise educational
               resources;
              •  own the copyright to the content they create (though this depends on
                their contract with the college or university); and
              •  make unilateral decisions regarding what content is used in their
               courses.
            As such, higher education faculty are often OER producers and can decide
         whether or not to adopt these OER in their courses. OER adoption in higher
          education tends to occur one faculty member at a time. Given this opportunity,

            it is critical that faculty members be given the time, resources, and support
            they need in order to create and adopt open education content and undertake
            a shift to open education practices and pedagogy. For an example of this sort
            of endeavor, see the open textbook Clinical Procedures for Safer Patient Care
             that was written by faculty from British Columbia (licensed CC BY 4.0 at https://
             opentextbc.ca/clinicalskills/).
                In general, primary and secondary (K−12) teachers are less likely to:
                  •  have the time, resources, and support to produce and revise educational
                 resources;
                  •  own the copyright to the content they create (though this depends on
                   their contract with the school or district); and
                  •  make unilateral decisions regarding what content is used in their 
                curriculum.
               As such, OER adoption in primary and secondary schools tends to occur at
             the district or school level, rather than at the level of individual teachers. For
            an example of this, see the blog post Creative Commons policies grow in New
            Zealand schools (https://creativecommons.org/2014/10/06/creative-commons 
            -policies-grow-in-new-zealand-schools/).
          Open Educational Resources (a very brief timeline)
            While there isn’t enough space in this section to give a comprehensive overview
             of the “History of Open Education,” here are several of the pivotal events
            that contributed to the growth of the Open Education movement.

              •  2019: UNESCO approves bringing 2019 UNESCO OER Recommendation
               to the next General Conference.
       Final Remarks
         OER, whether organized as open textbooks or open courseware, provide teachers
          , learners, and others with a broad range of permissions that make education
         more affordable and more flexible. These permissions also enable rapid, lowcost
          experimentation and innovation, as educators seek to maximize access to
          effective educational resources for all.
        5.4 | FINDING, EVALUATING, AND ADAPTING RESOURCES
          We live in a rich multimedia culture that requires educators to provide relevant
          learning resources in the classroom, although finding and reusing others’
          great works is not always simple. This section will teach you how to find others’
         OER and adapt them for use in your own classroom.

               Librarians play an important role in the discovery, development, description
             , licensing, curation, and sharing of Open Educational Resources. They also
            have an opportunity to advocate for and support the use of these resources.
             This section will also guide you through a practical approach to supporting the
            adoption of OER.
          THE BIG QUESTION: WHY IT MATTERS
            What skills and knowledge are needed to find just the right OER that you and
            your learners need? If you are going to join the global Open Education community
             , find the best open resources for your course, and share your good work as
            an OER, you need to know—and know how to teach others—how to find, evaluate
             , and adapt openly licensed resources. And what if we want to think bigger . . . 
            what effect might Open Education have globally?
               Why is the openness of content—the ability to revise, remix, and share it—so
           important? If the public had access to and could creatively remix the world’s
            knowledge, what new opportunities might we find to address global challenges
             (e.g., the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals)?
         LEARNING OUTCOMES
                  •  Find OER in open repositories, or by using Google, CC Search, or other
                platforms
                  •  Evaluate how to reuse, revise, and remix the OER you find
                  •  Demonstrate how different OER can be used together, while paying
                   attention to license compatibility

          - 112 - CHAPTER 5

        PERSONAL REFLECTION: WHY IT MATTERS TO YOU
          Where do you currently find your learning resources? Do you seek open alternatives
          for the materials you currently use? How do you evaluate your existing
         learning resources, and how can you apply those measures to openly licensed
         content?
             Once you identify the learning resources you currently use, ask yourself the
          following questions:
              •  Is this resource freely available to all of my learners?
              •  Can my learners and I keep a copy of this resource forever?
              •  Does my class have the legal rights to fix errors, update old or inaccurate
               content, improve the work, and share it with other educators around the
             world?
              •  Can my learners contribute to and improve our learning resources as
               part of their course work?
             If the answer to these questions is “No,” then you’re probably using learning
          resources that don’t provide the legal permissions you and your learners need
          to do what you want to do. Conversely, if you answered “Yes” to all of the questions
          , then you’re probably using OER.
       Acquiring Essential Knowledge
       FINDING RESOURCES
         Not everything on the Internet is an open educational resource, and some
          works labeled as “open” may not have the legal permissions to exercise the 5Rs.
         So how do you recognize OER, and how do you choose which OER will work best
          in your class?

                     First, for a short introduction on how to find OER, watch the
                  video How Can I Find OER? https://www.youtube.com/watch 
                  ?v=NJRIaQkiWKw | CC BY NC 4.0

             Finding the resources you want to use is the first step to bringing OER into
         your classroom. Discovery is one of the primary barriers for educators who
         want to use OER. Fortunately, there are many established ways to search for
          these resources.

               You can do a quick review of OER projects and people on the OER World Map
            (licensed CC BY 4.0 at https://oerworldmap.org/) to get a sense of global OER
              activities.
               There are many websites that host large collections of OER (e.g., Wikimedia
            Commons), but some universities also host their own OER repositories and services.
            A good first step is to do a general OER search using Google Advanced
             Search and filter your results by “Usage Rights” (on the pull-down menu at the
             bottom of the screen). See Google’s post on how to use the tool effectively at
            https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/07/find-creative-commons-images-with
            -image.html.
               In addition to sharing your OER on your website or blog, there are hundreds 
            of online platforms on which you can share your openly licensed content. 
            Creative Commons maintains a directory of some of the most popular platforms
             used by educators, organized by content type (photos, video, audio, textbooks,
            courses, etc.) at https://creativecommons.org/about/program-areas/education 
             -oer/education-oer-resources/. You can also find OER on these platforms.
               When looking for OER, open educators often ask each other for help on Open
             Education discussion lists. Here is a non-exhaustive tally of discussion lists you
             might be interested in joining:
                  •  CC Open Education Platform (invitation)
                  •  OER Forum
                  •  International OER Advocacy
                  •  OER Discuss
                  •  Open Knowledge Open Edu
                  •  Open Edu SIG
                  •  Wikimedia Education
                  •  US OER Advocacy
                  •  SPARC: Library OER
                  •  Educause Openness
               If you want to know more about the most popular general options for searching
            for OER, read the Open Washington course Module 6: Finding OER (licensed
            CC BY 4.0 at http://www.openwa.org/module-6-2/). 
               Creative Commons redesigned its CC Search (figure 5.5).12 You can explore
            the initial version of the new search engine (images only) at https://ccsearch 
            .creativecommons.org. Soon, CC Search will be able to search the entire Commons
            —all of the public domain and CC-licensed works on the Internet . . .
            including OER.

       EVALUATING RESOURCES
         As with all education resources, OER need to be evaluated before use. Educators
         who are new to OER may have concerns about their quality because these
          resources are available for free and may have been remixed by other educators.
          But the process of using and evaluating OER is not that different from evaluating
          traditional “all rights reserved” copyright resources. Whether education materials
          are openly licensed or closed, you are the best judge of quality because you
         know what your learners need and what your curriculum demands.
             Subject specialists (educators and librarians) assess the quality and suitability
          of learning resources. The membership organization JISC provides a list of
          criteria for the assessment of the quality of these resources.
              •  Accuracy
              •  Reputation of author/institution
              •  Standard of technical production
              •  Accessibility
              •  Fitness for purpose13
             You should be careful not to let anyone tell you that OER are “low quality”
         because they are free. As the SPARC OER Mythbusting Guide points out:
              •  In this increasingly digital and Internet-connected world, the old adage
              that “you get what you pay for” is growing outdated. New models are
                developing across all aspects of society that dramatically reduce or eliminate
                costs to users, and this kind of innovation has spread to educational
               resources.

                       CREATiVE COMMONS FOR LiBRARiANS AND EDucATORS - 115 -

                  •  OER publishers have worked to ensure the quality of their resources.
                 Many open textbooks are created within rigorous editorial and peerreview
                 guidelines, and many OER repositories allow faculty to review
                  (and see others’ reviews of) the material. There is also a growing body of
                 evidence which demonstrates that OER can be both free of cost and high
                 quality—and more importantly, they can support positive student learning
                  outcomes.14 
               Also, be careful not to get pulled into a debate about high- or low-quality
            educational resources when what educators should really be concerned about
             is those resources’ effectiveness. Read these two posts from David Wiley: “Stop
            Say­ing ‘High Quality’” (https://opencontent.org/blog/archives/3821) and “No, 
           Really—Stop Saying ‘High Quality’” (https://opencontent.org/blog/archives/ 
             3830).
         Remixing and Adapting Resources
            Being open enables educators to use the resource more effectively, which can
            lead to better learning and student outcomes. OER can be remixed, adapted,
             updated, or tailored and improved locally to fit the needs of learners—for example
             , by translating the OER into a local language, adapting a biology open textbook
             to align it with local science standards, or modifying an OER simulation to
             make it accessible for a student who cannot hear.
               The ideas of remixing and adaptation are fundamental to education. The creative
            reuse of materials created by other educators and authors is about more
             than just seeking inspiration; we copy, adapt, and combine different materials
             in order to craft appropriate and effective education resources for our learners.
              Incorporating materials created by others and combining materials from
            different sources can be tricky, not only from a pedagogical perspective, but
             also from a copyright perspective.
               Online digital education resources have different legal permissions that
             empower (or not) the public to use, remix, and share those resources. Here are a
             few of those legal categories:
                  •  Public domain works (which are not restricted by any copyright) can be
                 remixed with any other work.
                        »» Example: Anyone can remix The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by
                        Mark Twain with Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll.
                  •  Some “all rights reserved” copyrighted works are available for free
                   online, but you can only use them under the project terms of service,

[Link]
https://unglue.it/accounts/edit/marc_config/
          - 116 - CHAPTER 5

                or by using an exception or limitation to copyright, such as fair use or
                fair dealing.
                     »» Example: Many MOOCs allow free reuse of their content, but do not
                      allow copying, revise, remix, or redistribution.
              •  “All rights reserved” copyrighted works in closed formats do not allow
                the public to remix or adapt the work.
                     »» Example: A blockbuster movie is usually available only on a
                     streaming service that you cannot use or even link to.
              •  Creative Commons-licensed works (and other free licenses) are open, but
               they may have various permissions and restrictions.
                     »» Example: The online encyclopedia Wikipedia (BY-SA) allows you
                    to reuse its content for commercial purposes, while WikiHow
                     (BY-NC-SA) does not. A Wikipedia article cannot be remixed with a
                   WikiHow article.
           If you want to know which CC-licensed works can be remixed with other
          CC-licensed works, see figure 5.6, which repeats the CC remix chart (figure 4.12)
          that we studied in chapter 4. In this chart, where there is a check mark at the
         intersection of two CC-licensed works, you can remix those two works. Where
          there is a black X, you cannot remix those two CC-licensed works.
       MARC Records and Metadata
         There are metadata standards for OER that allow searchability, organization,
          and integration into current content systems at your institution. Metadata can
          include information such as author, title, subject area, grade level, keywords,
          and other categorical information.
            There are many sources whereby you can easily include open textbooks in
         your library collection. UnGlue.it has a comprehensive database of Creative
          Commons ebooks. In 2014 they added 1,897 free ebooks, and of these, 1,076 of
          them have Creative Commons licenses. Unglue.it has also added librarian tools
          (https://unglue.it/accounts/edit/marc_config/ ) to allow users to download and
         upload customizable MARC (machine-readable cataloging) records. As free,
          openly licensed resources, OER often live outside of the catalog, and cataloging
          standards can differ between repositories. You can check out the WorldCat
          catalog record for OpenStax to see what an OER might look like in the catalog

             to discuss this question.
             The Open Textbook Library and BC Campus also provide MARC bibliographic
             records for OER. The Open Textbook Library also uses CC0 for all of its
           MARC records. You can read more about how to use CC for MARC records at
             http://dltj.org/article/cc0-marc-records/.
         Final Remarks
            We live in an amazing world of information abundance, and an increasing percentage
             of our digital knowledge is openly licensed. But finding the right open
             resources that fit the needs of your learning spaces and your learners can be a
             challenge. One of the major motivations for using OER is the ability to revise,
             remix, and share these works in ways that will best suit the needs of your learners.
             Search engines, OER repositories, and platform services with built-in tools
            for using Creative Commons licenses help, but finding the right OER can still
             take time for your faculty and library patrons to accomplish.

          - 118 - CHAPTER 5

        5.5 | CREATING AND SHARING OER
          Large parts of this book are about creation, both how it works from a legal perspective
          and, more practically, how we learn by making and creating something.
          In this section we will explore and practice how to create and share OER so they
          can have the biggest impact and be used without any legal or technical barriers.
        THE BIG QUESTION: WHY IT MATTERS
          A big part of any educator’s work is preparing, updating, and combining learning
          materials. Making those materials open requires just a few additional steps,
          and it’s easier than you think. What are those steps? What should you consider
          and expect when you want to create and publish your resources in the open?
            When we share our education resources as OER, we share our best practices,
          our expertise, our challenges and solutions. Education is about sharing. And
         when we share our work with more people, we become better educators.
       LEARNING OUTCOMES
              •  Imagine how your OER will work in practice
              •  Understand how to select CC licenses for your resources
              •  Examine your open license decision for compatibility (i.e., can it 
               be remixed) with other OER
              •  Identify the needs and challenges to improving OER accessibility 
              for everyone
        Personal Reflection: Why It Matters To You
         What kind of learning resources do you create now? Do you publish or share
         these resources with other people for feedback? Which of your resources do
          you think could benefit fellow educators, learners, researchers, and libraries?
          If you choose to share, how much freedom do you want to give to others; in other
          words, what permissions will you allow for others to reuse your work?


                    For an introduction on why it is important to share your work
                   as an OER, watch the video Open Education Matters: Why
                   Is It Important to Share Content? https://www.youtube.com/

         Acquiring Essential Knowledge
         WHY SHARE?
            Because educators and librarians can share OER with everyone for near zero
             cost,15 we should do this. After all, education is fundamentally about sharing
             knowledge and ideas. Libraries are about archiving, sharing, and helping learners
             to find the knowledge they seek. When we CC-license our work, we are sharing
            that work with the public under simple, legal permissions. Sharing your
              work is a gift to the world.
          CHOOSING A CC LICENSE FOR OER
            As you may remember, not all educational materials that are available under a
             CC license are OER. Review the chart in figure 5.7 that details which CC licenses
            work well for education resources and which do not.
              The two CC NoDerivatives (ND) licenses are not OER-compatible licenses
             because they don’t allow the public to revise or remix the educational resource.
            Because the ND licenses do not meet the 5Rs or any of the major OER definitions
           , the Open Education movement does not consider ND-licensed educational
             resources to be “OER.”

            Choosing the right license for your OER requires you to think about which
         permissions you want to give to other users—and which permissions you want
         to retain for yourself. Read the statement “Open Textbook Community Advocates
         CC BY License for Open Textbooks” (licensed CC BY 4.0 at https://open 
         .bccampus.ca/2016/11/04/open-textbook-community-advocates-cc-by-license 
         -for-open-textbooks/) and think about why they recommend the Creative Commons
         Attribution license (CC BY) for education. You can find more arguments
          made about the utility of this same license for publishing scientific research in
         the article “Why CC BY?” from the Open Access Scholarly Publishers Association
          (licensed CC BY 4.0 at https://oaspa.org/why-cc-by/).
             For basic information about the licenses, and how to choose and apply one to
          your work or to combined works from other people and sources, revisit section
          4.1 “Choosing and Applying a CC License.”
        CC LICENSE LEGAL CASES IN OPEN EDUCATION
          For a detailed analysis of Creative Commons case law, see section 3.4 “License
         Enforceability.” Creative Commons maintains a listing of court decisions and
          case law from jurisdictions around the world on its wiki, licensed CC BY 4.0 at
         https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Case_Law.
            In 2017−18 there were two legal cases concerning Open Education: Great
          Minds vs. FedEx Office and Great Minds vs. Office Depot, as referenced in chapter
          4. As a reminder, both cases involved OER used by schools for non-commercial
          purposes. In both cases, the district courts found that a commercial copy shop
          may reproduce educational materials at the request of a school district that is
          using them under a CC BY-NC-SA license; thus, no license copyright infringement
          or violation of the CC license had occurred.
       OTHER CONSIDERATIONS
        Other than choosing the right CC license, what other aspects of openness
          and pedagogy are worth considering? You can read a list of best practices to
         include in your work when building OER at https://maricopa.instructure.com/

              The Open Washington network’s Module 8 on “Sharing OER” (licensed CC
            BY 4.0, available at http://www.openwa.org/module-8/) will give you practical
             advice on how to share OER online and prepare them to be used offline as well.
          ENSURING THAT OER ARE ACCESSIBLE TO EVERYONE
             At its core, OER are about making sure that everyone has access to learning and
             research materials. Not just rich people, not just people who can see or hear, not
            just people who can read English—everyone.
               As authors and institutions build and share OER, best practices in accessibility
             need to be part of their instructional and technical design from the start.
            Educators have legal and ethical responsibilities to ensure that our learning
             resources are fully accessible to all learners, including those with disabilities.
                The best practices to ensure that your OER are accessible to all include:
                  •  putting your work into the public domain (CC0) or adding a non-ND CC
                  license to your work;
                  •  making it simple to download your work in editable file formats, so others
                   can modify or translate it to meet local needs and make it accessible; and
                  •  most importantly, designing your work to be accessible from the start.

          - 122 - CHAPTER 5

        LIBRARY WEBSITES, LIBRARY SUBJECT GUIDES, CATALOGING,
       AND CREATIVE COMMONS
         Librarians who find themselves in the role of content creators may wonder
         how to license their work. Over 5,000 institutions in the United States use
         LibGuides as their preferred subject guide content management system, with
          over 120,000 license holders around the world. Licensing your resources under
         Creative Commons can be as simple as using the license chooser to create a
          machine-readable icon for your site or LibGuide.
            There are hundreds of LibGuides on library websites about Creative Commons
         alone. Use Google to search for LibGuides about Creative Commons and
          flip through the resources found by subject librarians on the issues of Creative
         Commons and copyright.
       Final Remarks
         Openness in education means more than just access or legal certainty over
         what you are able to use, modify, and share with your learners. Open Education
         means designing content and practices which will ensure that everyone
          can actively participate and contribute to the sum of all human knowledge. As
          educators and learners revise others’ OER and create and share new OER, accessibility
          should always be on your design checklist.
        5.6 | OPENING UP YOUR INSTITUTION
         This section discusses how educational institutions can support open education
          content, practices, and community with policy.
        THE BIG QUESTION: WHY IT MATTERS
          Educational institutions around the world are trying to figure out how to support
          their educators, staff, and learners in using, revising, and sharing OER in
          the context of new Open Education practices. How can educational leaders use
         various policy tools to support and promote Open Education?
       LEARNING OUTCOMES
              •  Consider if and why you need a policy to accomplish your Open 
               Education goals
              •  Understand the menu of Open Education policy options
              •  Assess your existing institutional policies
              •  Understand how to develop an institutional open policy

          PERSONAL REFLECTION: WHY IT MATTERS TO YOU
            What if there were institutional policies that supported your Open Education
            and open access efforts? What effect might pro-Open Access and pro-Open 
            Education policies have on you and your learners?
          Acquiring Essential Knowledge 
            Educational institutions have a broad menu of Open Education policy options
             from which to choose. Your institution can:
                  •  Raise awareness of the existence of OER and their benefits for your learners
                   and faculty.
                        »» Action: Host an annual “Open Education” day at your school or uni-
                          versity.
                  •  Empower stakeholders to drive your institution’s Open Education strategy.
                        »» Action: Create an Open Education Task Force comprised of learners,
                        faculty, accessibility experts, deans, bookstore, financial aid, and
                         library staff, instructional designers, eLearning, and so on.
                  •  Ensure that all of the content you fund is OER.
                        »» Action: Draft, adopt, and implement an open licensing policy
                      requiring university or school-funded resources to be openly
                      licensed (preferably CC BY 4.0). Use the OER Policy Development
                       Tool (licensed CC BY 4.0, available at http://policy.lumenlearning 
                       .com/) to build an open policy for your institution. You can find
                      examples of open policies that others have created at the OER 
                        Policy Registry (global; licensed CC BY 4.0, available at https:// 
                      wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/OER_Policy_Registry) and SPARC’s

                  •  Issue a call-to-action to solve an educational challenge.
                        »» Action: Create an OER grant program. You could appropriate funds
                        for supporting faculty and staff to shift your fifty highest-enrolled
                       courses from closed content to OER.
                        Example: The Maricopa County Community College started an
                             open textbook initiative to lower the costs of teaching materials.
                          They provided grants to create open courses and train faculty
                         on OER. You can learn more about their process at https://

              •  Leverage existing strategic documents to support Open Education.
                     »» Action: Add Open Education goals to your institution’s key strategy
                  documents.
                     »» Action: Identify and track key performance indicators that improve
                    when courses and/or degrees adopt OER.
                      Example: Increasing student outcomes, increasing the percentage
                        of learners who can access 100 percent of the learning
                        resources on day 1, reducing dropouts during add/drop periods,
                         increasing credits taken per semester, decreasing student debt,
                         decreasing time to degree.
              •  Make it easy to share OER.
                     »» Action: Join a global OER repository and make it simple for your
                     educators and learners to find others’ OER and share their own OER.
                    Provide professional development.
              •  Ensure that educators have the legal rights to share.
                     »» Action: Change the contract between the institution and the faculty
                      or teachers so that these educators have the legal rights to CC- 
                     license their work.
                      Example: A Creative Commons policy in New Zealand gives
                       teachers advance permission to disseminate their resources
                         online for sharing and reuse. The policy also ensures that both
                        the school and the teacher—as well as teachers from around the
                       country and around the world—can continue to use and adapt
                       resources produced by New Zealand teachers in the course of
                         their employment. Creative Commons NZ has developed an
                         annotated policy template for schools to adapt (http://resources 
                        .creativecommons.org.nz/cc-schools-policy/).
              •  Provide OER information to learners.
                     »» Action: Require OER Course designations in course catalogs so
                    learners can see whether (or not) a course uses an OER or an open
                    textbook.
                         Example: The City University of New York labels OER in its cata-­ 
                        log; see the video. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRjTRza_I18

                  •  Reward sharing.
                        »» Action: Adjust promotion and tenure policies to reward the creation,
                      adoption, and maintenance of OER and publishing in Open Access
                       journals. The creation and adaptation of OER should be appropriately
                       recognized as curricular innovation and service to the academic
                      profession during promotion and tenure review.
          ENFORCING OPEN EDUCATION AND OPEN ACCESS POLICIES
            The point of most Open Education and Open Access policies is to ensure that
            publicly (or foundation) funded education and research resources (1) can be
             read by everyone, (2) are openly licensed, and (3) are shared in editable file formats
            in public repositories, with a zero embargo period, which provides immediate
            public access upon publication. Creative Commons often uses the catchphrase
            “publicly funded resources should be openly licensed resources—the
            public should have access to what it funds.” When it comes to enforcing Open
           Education and Open Access policies, multiple people and institutions play
            important roles.
              Government, foundation, and institutional funders and program officers
            responsible for managing grants and contracts need to (1) understand their
            Open Education/Access policies, (2) communicate the importance of these policies
             to grantees verbally and in writing, and (3) check to ensure that the public
             has full access to the openly licensed resources, research, and data under the
            terms of the Open Education and Open Access policy.
               University or college administration should provide support (e.g., by hiring
            a full-time OA or OER librarian) to faculty who are publishing in Open Access
            journals or otherwise sharing their research openly and to faculty who are
             creating, remixing, sharing, and adopting OER. Institutions should also review
            and modify (as needed) promotion and tenure policies to ensure that faculty
            who are engaged in Open Education and Open Access publishing are rewarded
            during promotion and tenure review.16
         Final Remarks
            When educational institutions support their educators, staff, and learners in
            moving from closed to open content and practices, Open Education thrives.
             Educators want to design the best courses, adjust their practices and pedagogy
            to empower learners to co-create knowledge, and push the limits of knowledge

                    both digital and printed formats. Of course, digital OER are easier to share, modify
                    , and redistribute, but being digital is not what makes something an OER or not.
