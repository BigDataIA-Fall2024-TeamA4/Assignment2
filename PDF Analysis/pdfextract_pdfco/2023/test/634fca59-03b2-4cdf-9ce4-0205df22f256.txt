            Article: Reviewing the STEM Barrier 
                The purpose of this research was to investigate the current state of access to journal papers in
               Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields. A comprehensive review was
               conducted to explore the barriers that hinder equal and open access to STEM field knowledge. This
               study analyzed the impact of subscriptions, publication costs, and limited access on researchers,
               students, and general knowledge. It examined the role of open access, preprint, and alternative
                publishing in diversity and inclusivity of knowledge. This article provides an overview of challenges
               and suggests solutions for addressing the knowledge barrier in STEM fields and the greater
                scientific community.

               Moore, A. was brought onto the research team after the conceptualization and methodology design
               of the study. He was provided with annotated research data from previous research and
                investigation, resources with which to conduct his work, and financial support acquired prior to his
                 participation. 
               Moore, A. was supervised by the study lead, who managed all research activity related to the study,
               validated the tests used by Moore, and provided Mooreâ€™s data to the visualization and writing
               team.
