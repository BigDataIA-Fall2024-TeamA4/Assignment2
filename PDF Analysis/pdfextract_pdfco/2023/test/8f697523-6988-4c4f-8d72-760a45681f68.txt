     This essayassumes that the ultimate expression of sovereignty resides, to a
          large degree, in the power and the capacity to dictate who may live and who
      must die.1 Hence, to kill or to allow to live constitute the limits of sovereignty, its

         1. The essay distances itself from traditional accounts of sovereignty found in the discipline of
      political science and the subdiscipline of international relations. For the most part, these accounts
      locate sovereignty within the boundaries of the nation-state, within institutions empowered by the
      state, or within supranational institutions and networks. See, for example, Sovereignty at the Millen-
      nium, special issue, Political Studies 47 (1999). My own approach builds on Michel Foucault’s critique
      of the notion of sovereignty and its relation to war and biopower in Il faut défendre la société: Cours
      au Collège de France, 1975–1976 (Paris: Seuil, 1997), 37–55, 75–100, 125–48, 213–44. See also

      Public Culture            fundamental attributes. To exercise sovereignty is to exercise control over mortality
                              and to de ne life as the deployment and manifestation of power.
                       One could summarize in the above terms what Michel Foucault meant by
                          biopower: that domain of life over which power has taken control.2 But under
                              what practical conditions is the right to kill, to allow to live, or to expose to death
                         exercised? Who is the subject of this right? What does the implementation of
                              such a right tell us about the person who is thus put to death and about the relation
                            of enmity that sets that person against his or her murderer? Is the notion of
                             biopower suf cient to account for the contemporary ways in which the political,
                              under the guise of war, of resistance, or of the  ght against terror, makes the murder
                              of the enemy its primary and absolute objective? War, after all, is as much a
                              means of achieving sovereignty as a way of exercising the right to kill. Imagining
                              politics as a form of war, we must ask: What place is given to life, death, and the
                             human body (in particular the wounded or slain body)? How are they inscribed in
                             the order of power?

                              In order to answer these questions, this essay draws on the concept of biopower and
                              explores its relation to notions of sovereignty ( imperium) and the state of excep-
                              tion.3 Such an analysis raises a number of empirical and philosophical questions I
                              would like to examine brie y. As is well known, the concept of the state of exception
                              has been often discussed in relation to Nazism, totalitarianism, and the concentration
                            /extermination camps. The death camps in particular have been interpreted
                              variously as the central metaphor for sovereign and destructive violence and
                             as the ultimate sign of the absolute power of the negative. Says Hannah Arendt:
                              “There are no parallels to the life in the concentration camps. Its horror can never
                              be fully embraced by the imagination for the very reason that it stands outside of
                              life and death.”4 Because its inhabitants are divested of political status and reduced
                              to bare life, the camp is, for Giorgio Agamben, “the place in which the most absolute
                              conditio inhumana ever to appear on Earth was realized.”5 In the political-juridical
                              structure of the camp, he adds, the state of exception ceases to be a temporal sus-

      arrangement that remains continually outside the normal state of law.
         The aim of this essay is not to debate the singularity of the extermination of the
      Jews or to hold it up by way of example.6 I start from the idea that modernity was
      at the origin of multiple concepts of sovereignty—and therefore of the biopolitical.
      Disregarding this multiplicity, late-modern political criticism has unfortunately
      privileged normative theories of democracy and has made the concept of
      reason one of the most important elements of both the project of modernity and of
      the topos of sovereignty.7 From this perspective, the ultimate expression of sovereignty
      is the production of general norms by a body (the demos) made up of free
     and equal men and women. These men and women are posited as full subjects
      capable of self-understanding, self-consciousness, and self-representation. Politics
      , therefore, is de ned as twofold: a project of autonomy and the achieving of
      agreement among a collectivitythrough communicationand recognition. This, we
      are told, is what differentiates it from war.8
         In other words, it is on the basis of a distinction between reason and unreason
      (passion, fantasy) that late-modern criticism has been able to articulate a certain
      idea of the political, the community, the subject—or, more fundamentally, of
      what the good life is all about, how to achieve it, and, in the process, to become a
      fully moral agent. Within this paradigm, reason is the truth of the subject and politics
      is the exercise of reason in the public sphere. The exercise of reason is tantamount
      to the exercise of freedom, a key element for individual autonomy. The
     romance of sovereignty, in this case, rests on the belief that the subject is the
     master and the controlling author of his or her own meaning. Sovereignty is
      therefore de ned as a twofold process of self-institution and self-limitation ( xing
      one’s own limits for oneself). The exercise of sovereignty, in turn, consists in
      society’s capacity for self-creation through recourse to institutions inspired by
      speci c social and imaginary signi cations.9
        This strongly normative reading of the politics of sovereignty has been the

      the “Final Solution” (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1992); and, more recently, Bertrand

      Public Culture            object of numerous critiques, which I will not rehearse here.10 My concern is
                              those  gures of sovereignty whose central project is not the struggle for autonomy
                             but the generalized instrumentalization of human existence and the material
                             destruction of human bodies and populations. Such  gures of sovereignty are far
                        from a piece of prodigious insanity or an expression of a rupture between the
                             impulses and interests of the body and those of the mind. Indeed, they, like the
                            death camps, are what constitute the nomos of the political space in which we
                             still live. Furthermore, contemporary experiences of human destruction suggest
                              that it is possible to develop a reading of politics, sovereignty, and the subject different
                             from the one we inherited from the philosophical discourse of modernity.
                             Instead of considering reason as the truth of the subject, we can look to other
                             foundational categories that are less abstract and more tactile, such as life and
                            death.
                                Signi cant for such a project is Hegel’s discussion of the relation between
                             death and the “becoming subject.” Hegel’s account of death centers on a bipartite
                              concept of negativity. First, the human negates nature (a negation exteriorized in
                             the human’s effort to reduce nature to his or her own needs); and second, he or
                            she transforms the negated element through work and struggle. In transforming
                             nature, the human being creates a world; but in the process, he or she also is
                         exposed to his or her own negativity. Within the Hegelian paradigm, human
                              death is essentially voluntary. It is the result of risks consciously assumed by the
                              subject. According to Hegel, in these risks the “animal” that constitutesthe human
                              subject’s natural being is defeated.
                               In other words, the human being truly becomes a subject—that is, separated
                        from the animal—in the struggle and the work through which he or she confronts
                              death (understood as the violence of negativity). It is through this confrontation
                              with death that he or she is cast into the incessant movement of history.
                            Becoming subject therefore supposes upholdingthe work of death. To uphold the
                              work of death is precisely how Hegel de nes the life of the Spirit. The life of the
                              Spirit, he says, is not that life which is frightened of death, and spares itself
                              destruction, but that life which assumes death and lives with it. Spirit attains its
                              truth only by  nding itself in absolute dismemberment.11 Politics is therefore
                                 10. See, in particular, Paul Gilroy, The Black Atlantic: Modernity and Double Consciousness

      death that lives a human life. Such, too, is the de nition of absolute knowledge             Necropolitics
      and sovereignty: risking the entirety of one’s life.
         Georges Bataille also offers critical insights into how death structures the idea
      of sovereignty, the political, and the subject. Bataille displaces Hegel’s conception
      of the linkages between death, sovereignty, and the subject in at least three
      ways. First, he interprets death and sovereignty as the paroxysm of exchange and
     superabundance—or, to use his own terminology: excess. For Bataille, life is
      defective only when death has taken it hostage. Life itself exists only in bursts
      and in exchange with death.12 He argues that death is the putrefaction of life, the
      stench that is at once the source and the repulsive condition of life. Therefore,
      although it destroys what was to be, obliterates what was supposed to continue
      being, and reduces to nothing the individual who takes it, death does not come
      down to the pure annihilationof being. Rather, it is essentially self-consciousness;
      moreover, it is the most luxurious form of life, that is, of effusion and exuberance
     : a power of proliferation. Even more radically, Bataille withdraws death
     from the horizon of meaning. This is in contrast to Hegel, for whom nothing is
      de nitively lost in death; indeed, death is seen as holding great signi cation as a
      means to truth.
         Second, Bataille  rmly anchors death in the realm of absolute expenditure (the
      other characteristic of sovereignty), whereas Hegel tries to keep death within the
      economy of absolute knowledge and meaning. Life beyond utility, says Bataille,
      is the domain of sovereignty. This being the case, death is therefore the point at
      which destruction, suppression, and sacri ce constitute so irreversible and radical
     an expenditure—an expenditure without reserve—that they can no longer be
     determined as negativity. Death is therefore the very principle of excess—an
     anti-economy. Hence the metaphor of luxury and of the luxurious character of
      death.
         Third, Bataille establishes a correlation among death, sovereignty, and sexuality.
      Sexuality is inextricably linked to violence and to the dissolution of the
      boundaries of the body and self by way of orgiastic and excremental impulses. As
      such, sexuality concerns two major forms of polarized human impulses—excretion
      and appropriation—as well as the regime of the taboos surrounding them.13
      The truth of sex and its deadly attributes reside in the experience of loss of the
      boundaries separating reality, events, and fantasized objects.

      Public Culture               For Bataille, sovereignty therefore has many forms. But ultimately it is the
                              refusal to accept the limits that the fear of death would have the subject respect.
                              The sovereign world, Bataille argues, “is the world in which the limit of death is
                              done away with. Death is present in it, its presence de nes that world of violence,
                              but while death is present it is always there only to be negated, never for anything
                              but that. The sovereign,” he concludes, “is he who is, as if death were not. . . . He
                              has no more regard for the limits of identity than he does for limits of death, or
                              rather these limits are the same; he is the transgression of all such limits.” Since
                              the natural domain of prohibitions includes death, among others (e.g., sexuality,
                               lth, excrement), sovereignty requires “the strength to violate the prohibition
                              against killing, although it’s true this will be under the conditions that customs
                              de ne.” And contrary to subordination that is always rooted in necessity and the
                              alleged need to avoid death, sovereignty de nitely calls for the risk of death.14
                                 By treating sovereignty as the violation of prohibitions, Bataille reopens the
                            question of the limits of the political. Politics, in this case, is not the forward
                              dialectical movement of reason. Politics can only be traced as a spiral transgression
                              , as that difference that disorients the very idea of the limit. More speci cally,
                              politics is the difference put into play by the violation of a taboo.15

                            Biopower and the Relation of Enmity
                              Having presented a reading of politics as the work of death, I turn now to sovereignty
                              , expressed predominantly as the right to kill. For the purpose of my argument
                             , I relate Foucault’s notion of biopower to two other concepts: the state of
                              exception and the state of siege.16 I examine those trajectories by which the state
                             of exception and the relation of enmity have become the normative basis of the
                              right to kill. In such instances, power (and not necessarily state power) continuously
                              refers and appeals to exception, emergency, and a  ctionalized notion
                             of the enemy. It also labors to produce that same exception, emergency, and  ctionalizedenemy.
                              In other words, the question is: What is the relationship between
                              politics and death in those systems that can function only in a state of emergency?
                                In Foucault’s formulation of it, biopower appears to function through dividing

      people into those who must live and those who must die. Operating on the basis             Necropolitics
      of a split between the living and the dead, such a power de nes itself in relation
      to a biological  eld—which it takes control of and vests itself in. This control
      presupposes the distribution of human species into groups, the subdivision of the
      populationinto subgroups, and the establishment of a biological caesura between
      the ones and the others. This is what Foucault labels with the (at  rst sight familiar
      ) term racism.17
         That race (or for that matter racism)  gures so prominently in the calculus of
      biopower is entirely justi able. After all, more so than class-thinking (the ideology
      that de nes history as an economic struggle of classes), race has been the
      ever present shadow in Western political thought and practice, especially when it
      comes to imagining the inhumanity of, or rule over, foreign peoples. Referring to
     both this ever-presence and the phantomlike world of race in general, Arendt
      locates their roots in the shattering experience of otherness and suggests that the
      politics of race is ultimately linked to the politics of death.18 Indeed, in Foucault’s
      terms, racism is above all a technology aimed at permitting the exercise of
      biopower, “that old sovereign right of death.”19 In the economy of biopower, the
      function of racism is to regulate the distribution of death and to make possible the
      murderous functions of the state. It is, he says, “the condition for the acceptability
      of putting to death.”20
         Foucault states clearly that the sovereign right to kill ( droit de glaive) and the
      mechanisms of biopower are inscribed in the way all modern states function;21
      indeed, they can be seen as constitutive elements of state power in modernity.
      According to Foucault, the Nazi state was the most complete example of a state
      exercising the right to kill. This state, he claims, made the management, protection
      , and cultivation of life coextensive with the sovereign right to kill. By biological
      extrapolation on the theme of the political enemy, in organizing the war
      against its adversaries and, at the same time, exposing its own citizens to war, the
      Nazi state is seen as having opened the way for a formidable consolidation of the
      right to kill, which culminated in the project of the “ nal solution.” In doing so, it
      became the archetype of a power formation that combined the characteristics of
      the racist state, the murderous state, and the suicidal state.

      Public Culture               It has been argued that the complete con ation of war and politics (and racism,
                              homicide, and suicide), until they are indistinguishablefrom one another, is unique
                             to the Nazi state. The perception of the existence of the Other as an attempt on
                              my life, as a mortal threat or absolute danger whose biophysicalelimination would
                              strengthen my potential to life and security— this, I suggest, is one of the many
                              imaginaries of sovereignty characteristic of both early and late modernity itself.
                           Recognition of this perception to a large extent underpins most traditional critiques
                             of modernity, whether they are dealing with nihilism and its proclamation
                              of the will for power as the essence of the being; with rei cation understood as
                            the becoming-object of the human being; or the subordination of everything to
                              impersonal logic and to the reign of calculability and instrumental rationality.22
                              Indeed, from an anthropological perspective, what these critiques implicitly contest
                              is a de nition of politics as the warlike relation par excellence. They also
                              challenge the idea that, of necessity, the calculus of life passes through the death
                              of the Other; or that sovereignty consists of the will and the capacity to kill in
                              order to live.
                            Taking a historical perspective, a number of analysts have argued that the
                             material premises of Nazi extermination are to be found in colonial imperialism
                              on the one hand and, on the other, in the serialization of technical mechanisms for
                            putting people to death—mechanisms developed between the Industrial Revolution
                            and the First World War. According to Enzo Traverso, the gas chambers and
                             the ovens were the culmination of a long process of dehumanizing and industrializing
                              death, one of the original features of which was to integrate instrumental
                              rationality with the productive and administrative rationality of the modern Western
                            world (the factory, the bureaucracy, the prison, the army). Having become
                             mechanized, serialized execution was transformed into a purely technical, impersonal
                             , silent, and rapid procedure. This development was aided in part by racist
                           stereotypes and the  ourishing of a class-based racism that, in translating the
                             social con icts of the industrial world in racial terms, ended up comparing the
                              working classes and “stateless people” of the industrial world to the “savages” of
                              the colonial world.23
                                 In reality, the links between modernity and terror spring from multiple sources.
                             Some are to be found in the political practices of the ancien régime. From this
                              perspective, the tension between the public’s passion for blood and notions of jus-

      tice and revenge is critical. Foucault shows in Discipline and Punish how the exe-             Necropolitics
      cution of the would-be regicide Damiens went on for hours, much to the satisfaction
      of the crowd.24 Well known is the long procession of the condemned through
      the streets prior to execution, the parade of body parts—a ritual that became a
      standard feature of popular violence—and the  nal display of a severed head
      mounted on a pike. In France, the advent of the guillotine marks a new phase in
     the “democratization” of the means of disposing of the enemies of the state.
      Indeed, this form of execution that had once been the prerogative of the nobility
      is extended to all citizens. In a context in which decapitation is viewed as less
      demeaning than hanging, innovations in the technologies of murder aim not only
      at “civilizing” the ways of killing. They also aim at disposing of a large number of
      victims in a relatively short span of time. At the same time, a new cultural sensibility
      emerges in which killing the enemy of the state is an extension of play.
      More intimate, lurid, and leisurely forms of cruelty appear.
         But nowhere is the con ation of reason and terror so manifest as during the
     French Revolution.25 During the French Revolution, terror is construed as an
      almost necessary part of politics. An absolute transparency is claimed to exist
      between the state and the people. As a political category, “the people” is gradually
      displaced from concrete reality to rhetorical  gure. As David Bates has
      shown, the theorists of terror believe it possible to distinguish between authentic
      expressions of sovereignty and the actions of the enemy. They also believe it possible
      to distinguish between the “error” of the citizen and the “crime” of the counterrevolutionary
      in the political sphere. Terror thus becomes a way of marking
      aberration in the body politic, and politics is read both as the mobile force of reason
      and as the errant attempt at creating a space where “error” would be reduced,
      truth enhanced, and the enemy disposed of.26
         Finally, terror is not linked solely to the utopian belief in the unfettered power
      of human reason. It is also clearly related to various narratives of mastery and
     emancipation, most of which are underpinned by Enlightenment understandings
      of truth and error, the “real” and the symbolic. Marx, for example, con ates labor
      (the endless cycle of production and consumption required for the maintenance
      of human life) with work (the creation of lasting artifacts that add to the world of
      things). Labor is viewed as the vehicle for the historical self-creation of humankind.

      Public Culture            The historical self-creation of humankind is itself a life-and-death con ict, that
                              is, a con ict over what paths should lead to the truth of history: the overcoming
                            of capitalism and the commodity form and the contradictions associated with
                           both. According to Marx, with the advent of communism and the abolition of
                              exchange relations, things will appear as they really are; the “real” will present
                              itself as it actually is, and the distinctionbetween subject and object or being and
                            consciousness will be transcended.27 But by making human emancipation dependent
                            upon the abolition of commodity production, Marx blurs the all-important
                           divisions among the man-made realm of freedom, the nature-determined realm
                              of necessity, and the contingent in history.
                              The commitment to the abolition of commodity production and the dream of
                             direct and unmediated access to the “real” make these processes—the ful llment
                             of the so-called logic of history and the fabrication of humankind—almost necessarily
                              violent processes. As shown by Stephen Louw, the central tenets of classical
                            Marxism leave no choice but to “try to introduce communism by administrative
                               at, which, in practice, means that social relations must be decommodi ed
                              forcefully.”28 Historically, these attempts have taken such forms as labor militarization
                              , the collapse of the distinctionbetween state and society, and revolutionary
                           terror.29 It may be argued that they aimed at the eradication of the basic
                              human condition of plurality. Indeed, the overcoming of class divisions, the withering
                              away of the state, the  owering of a truly general will presuppose a view of
                            human plurality as the chief obstacle to the eventual realization of a predetermined
                              telos of history. In other words, the subject of Marxian modernity is, fundamentally
                              , a subject who is intent on proving his or her sovereignty through the
                              staging of a  ght to the death. Just as with Hegel, the narrative of mastery and
                              emancipation here is clearly linked to a narrative of truth and death. Terror and
                             killing become the means of realizing the already known telos of history.

         Any historical account of the rise of modern terror needs to address slavery,             Necropolitics
      which could be considered one of the  rst instances of biopolitical experimentation.
      In many respects, the very structure of the plantation system and its aftermath
      manifests the emblematic and paradoxical  gure of the state of exception.30
      This  gure is paradoxical here for two reasons. First, in the context of the plantation
      , the humanity of the slave appears as the perfect  gure of a shadow. Indeed,
      the slave condition results from a triple loss: loss of a “home,” loss of rights over
      his or her body, and loss of political status. This triple loss is identical with absolute
      domination,natal alienation,and social death (expulsion from humanity altogether).
      To be sure, as a political-juridical structure, the plantation is a space where the
      slave belongs to a master. It is not a community if only because by de nition, a
     community implies the exercise of the power of speech and thought. As Paul
      Gilroy says, “The extreme patterns of communication de ned by the institution
      of plantation slavery dictate that we recognize the anti-discursive and extralinguistic
      rami cations of power at work in shaping communicative acts. There
      may, after all, be no reciprocity on the plantation outside of the possibilities of
      rebellion and suicide,  ight and silent mourning, and there is certainly no grammatical
      unity of speech to mediate communicative reason. In many respects, the
      plantation inhabitants live non-synchronously.”31 As an instrument of labor, the
      slave has a price. As a property, he or she has a value. His or her labor is needed
      and used. The slave is therefore kept alive but in a state of injury, in a phantomlike
      world of horrors and intense cruelty and profanity. The violent tenor of the
      slave’s life is manifested through the overseer’s disposition to behave in a cruel
     and intemperate manner and in the spectacle of pain in icted on the slave’s
      body.32 Violence, here, becomes an element in manners,33 like whipping or taking
      of the slave’s life itself: an act of caprice and pure destruction aimed at instilling
      terror.34 Slave life, in many ways, is a form of death-in-life. As Susan Buck-

      Public Culture            Morss has suggested, the slave condition produces a contradiction between freedom
                            of property and freedom of person. An unequal relationship is established
                          along with the inequality of the power over life. This power over the life of
                              another takes the form of commerce: a person’s humanity is dissolved to the point
                              where it becomes possible to say that the slave’s life is possessed by the master.35
                              Because the slave’s life is like a “thing,” possessed by another person, the slave
                              existence appears as a perfect  gure of a shadow.
                                 In spite of the terror and the symbolic sealing off of the slave, he or she maintains
                              alternative perspectives toward time, work, and self. This is the second
                           paradoxical element of the plantation world as a manifestation of the state of
                            exception. Treated as if he or she no longer existed except as a mere tool and
                              instrument of production, the slave nevertheless is able to draw almost any object,

                                 If the relations between life and death, the politics of cruelty, and the symbolics
                              of profanity are blurred in the plantation system, it is notably in the colony
                              and under the apartheid regime that there comes into being a peculiar terror formation
                              I will now turn to.37 The most original feature of this terror formation is
                              its concatenation of biopower, the state of exception, and the state of siege. Crucial
                              to this concatenation is, once again, race.38 In fact, in most instances, the

                                 37. In what follows I am mindful of the fact that colonial forms of sovereignty were always fragmented.
                              They were complex, “less concerned with legitimizing their own presence and more excessively
                              violent than their European forms.” As importantly, “European states never aimed at governing
                              the colonial territories with the same uniformity and intensity as was applied to their own populations.”

                                 38. In The Racial State (Malden, Mass: Blackwell, 2002), David Theo Goldberg argues that from
                              the nineteenth century on, there are at least two historically competing traditions of racial rationalization
                              : naturism (based on an inferiority claim) and historicism (based on the claim of the historical
                              “immaturity”—and therefore “educability”—of the natives). In a private communication (23 August
                              2002), he argues that these two traditions played out differently when it came to issues of sovereignty,
                              states of exception, and forms of necropower. In his view, necropower can take multiple forms: the
                              terror of actual death; or a more “benevolent” form—the result of which is the destruction of a culture
                              in order to “save the people” from themselves.

      selection of races, the prohibition of mixed marriages, forced sterilization, even             Necropolitics
      the extermination of vanquished peoples are to  nd their  rst testing ground in
      the colonialworld. Here we see the  rst syntheses between massacre and bureaucracy
      , that incarnation of Western rationality.39 Arendt develops the thesis that
      there is a link between national-socialism and traditional imperialism. According
      to her, the colonial conquest revealed a potential for violence previously unknown.
      What one witnesses in World War II is the extension to the “civilized” peoples of
      Europe of the methods previously reserved for the “savages.”
        That the technologies which ended up producing Nazism should have originated
      in the plantation or in the colony or that, on the contrary—Foucault’s thesis
      —Nazism and Stalinism did no more than amplify a series of mechanisms that
      already existed in Western European social and political formations (subjugation
      of the body, health regulations, social Darwinism, eugenics, medico-legal theories
      on heredity, degeneration, and race) is, in the end, irrelevant. A fact remains,
     though: in modern philosophical thought and European political practice and
      imaginary, the colony represents the site where sovereignty consists fundamentally
      in the exercise of a power outside the law ( ab legibus solutus) and where
      “peace” is more likely to take on the face of a “war without end.”
         Indeed, such a view corresponds to Carl Schmitt’s de nition of sovereignty at
      the beginning of the twentieth century, namely, the power to decide on the state of
      exception. To properly assess the ef cacy of the colony as a formation of terror,
      we need to take a detour into the European imaginary itself as it relates to the critical
      issue of the domestication of war and the creation of a European juridical
      order (Jus publicum Europaeum). At the basis of this order were two key principles.
      The  rst postulated the juridical equality of all states. This equality was
      notably applied to the right to wage war (the taking of life). The right to war meant
      two things. On the one hand, to kill or to conclude peace was recognized as one of
      the preeminent functions of any state. It went hand in hand with the recognition
      of the fact that no state could make claims to rule outside of its borders. But conversely
      , the state could recognize no authority above it within its own borders. On
      the other hand, the state, for its part, undertook to “civilize” the ways of killing
      and to attribute rational objectives to the very act of killing.
         The second principle related to the territorializationof the sovereign state, that
      is, to the determination of its frontiers within the context of a newly imposed
      global order. In this context, the Jus publicum rapidly assumed the form of a distinction
      between, on the one hand, those parts of the globe available for colonial
         39. Arendt, Origins of Totalitarianism, 185–221.

                                                                                  23

      Public Culture            appropriation and, on the other, Europe itself (where the Jus publicum was to
                              hold sway).40 This distinction, as we will see, is crucial in terms of assessing the
                              ef cacy of the colony as a terror formation. Under Jus publicum, a legitimate war
                              is, to a large extent, a war conducted by one state against another or, more precisely
                              , a war between “civilized” states. The centrality of the state in the calculus
                              of war derives from the fact that the state is the model of political unity, a principle
                             of rational organization, the embodiment of the idea of the universal, and a
                             moral sign.
                                 In the same context, colonies are similar to the frontiers. They are inhabited by
                             “savages.” The colonies are not organized in a state form and have not created a
                             human world. Their armies do not form a distinct entity, and their wars are not
                            wars between regular armies. They do not imply the mobilization of sovereign
                              subjects (citizens) who respect each other as enemies. They do not establish a distinction
                           between combatants and noncombatants, or again between an “enemy”
                        and a “criminal.”41 It is thus impossible to conclude peace with them. In sum,
                              colonies are zones in which war and disorder, internal and external  gures of the
                              political, stand side by side or alternate with each other. As such, the colonies are
                             the location par excellence where the controls and guarantees of judicial order
                        can be suspended—the zone where the violence of the state of exception is
                              deemed to operate in the service of “civilization.”
                            That colonies might be ruled over in absolute lawlessness stems from the
                            racial denial of any common bond between the conqueror and the native. In the
                              eyes of the conqueror, savage life is just another form of animal life, a horrifying
                             experience, something alien beyond imaginationor comprehension.In fact, according
                             to Arendt, what makes the savages different from other human beings is less
                              the color of their skin than the fear that they behave like a part of nature, that
                              they treat nature as their undisputed master. Nature thus remains, in all its majesty,
                            an overwhelming reality compared to which they appear to be phantoms, unreal
                             and ghostlike. The savages are, as it were, “natural” human beings who lack the
                              speci cally human character, the speci cally human reality, “so that when European
                           men massacred them they somehow were not aware that they had committed
                             murder.”42

         For all the above reasons, the sovereign right to kill is not subject to any rule             Necropolitics
      in the colonies. In the colonies, the sovereign might kill at any time or in any
      manner. Colonial warfare is not subject to legal and institutional rules. It is not a
      legally codi ed activity. Instead, colonial terror constantly intertwines with colonially
      generated fantasies of wilderness and death and  ctions to create the effect
      of the real.43 Peace is not necessarily the natural outcome of a colonial war. In
      fact, the distinctionbetween war and peace does not avail. Colonial wars are conceived
      of as the expression of an absolute hostility that sets the conqueror against
      an absolute enemy.44 All manifestations of war and hostility that had been marginalized
      by a European legal imaginary  nd a place to reemerge in the colonies.
     Here, the  ction of a distinction between “the ends of war” and the “means of
      war” collapses; so does the  ction that war functions as a rule-governed contest,
      as opposed to pure slaughter without risk or instrumental justi cation. It becomes
      futile, therefore, to attempt to resolve one of the intractable paradoxes of war
      well captured by Alexandre Kojève in his reinterpretation of Hegel’s Phenome-
      nology of the Spirit: its simultaneous idealism and apparent inhumanity.45

     Necropower and Late Modern Colonial Occupation
      It might be thought that the ideas developed above relate to a distant past. In the
      past, indeed, imperial wars did have the objective of destroying local powers,
      installing troops, and instituting new models of military control over civil populations.
      A group of local auxiliaries could assist in the management of conquered
      territories annexed to the empire. Within the empire, the vanquished populations
      were given a status that enshrined their despoilment. In these con gurations, violence
      constituted the original form of the right, and exception provided the structure
      of sovereignty. Each stage of imperialism also involved certain key technologies
      (the gunboat, quinine, steamship lines, submarine telegraph cables, and
      colonial railroads).46
         Colonial occupation itself was a matter of seizing, delimiting, and asserting
      control over a physical geographical area—of writing on the ground a new set of
      social and spatial relations. The writing of new spatial relations (territorializa-

                             zones and enclaves; the subversion of existing property arrangements; the classi
                               cation of people according to different categories; resource extraction; and,
                               nally, the manufacturing of a large reservoir of cultural imaginaries. These
                              imaginaries gave meaning to the enactment of differential rights to differing categories
                              of people for different purposes within the same space; in brief, the exercise
                             of sovereignty. Space was therefore the raw material of sovereignty and the
                             violence it carried with it. Sovereignty meant occupation, and occupation meant
                             relegating the colonized into a third zone between subjecthood and objecthood.
                                Such was the case of the apartheid regime in South Africa. Here, the township
                       was the structural form and the homelands became the reserves (rural bases)
                            whereby the  ow of migrant labor could be regulated and African urbanization
                             held in check.47 As Belinda Bozzoli has shown, the township in particular was a
                          place where “severe oppression and poverty were experienced on a racial and
                              class basis.”48 A sociopolitical, cultural, and economic formation, the township
                       was a peculiar spatial institution scienti cally planned for the purposes of control.49
                             The functioning of the homelands and townships entailed severe restrictions
                             on production for the market by blacks in white areas, the terminating of
                              land ownership by blacks except in reserved areas, the illegalizationof black residence
                              on white farms (except as servants in the employ of whites), the control of
                              urban in ux, and later, the denial of citizenship to Africans.50
                               Frantz Fanon describes the spatialization of colonial occupation in vivid
                              terms. For him, colonial occupation entails  rst and foremost a division of space
                              into compartments. It involves the setting of boundaries and internal frontiers
                              epitomizedby barracks and police stations; it is regulated by the language of pure
                             force, immediate presence, and frequent and direct action; and it is premised on
                              the principle of reciprocal exclusivity.51 But more important, it is the very way in
                             which necropower operates: “The town belonging to the colonized people . . . is
                                 47. On the township, see G. G. Maasdorp and A. S. B. Humphreys, eds., From Shantytown to

      a place of ill fame, peopled by men of evil repute. They are born there, it matters             Necropolitics
      little where or how; they die there, it matters not where, nor how. It is a world
      without spaciousness; men live there on top of each other. The native town is a
     hungry town, starved of bread, of meat, of shoes, of coal, of light. The native
      town is a crouching village, a town on its knees.”52 In this case, sovereigntymeans
      the capacity to de ne who matters and who does not, who is disposable and who
      is not.
       Late-modern colonial occupation differs in many ways from early-modern
      occupation, particularly in its combining of the disciplinary, the biopolitical, and
      the necropolitical. The most accomplished form of necropower is the contemporary
      colonial occupation of Palestine.
         Here, the colonial state derives its fundamental claim of sovereignty and legitimacy
      from the authority of its own particular narrative of history and identity.
      This narrative is itself underpinned by the idea that the state has a divine right to
      exist; the narrative competes with another for the same sacred space. Because the
      two narratives are incompatible and the two populations are inextricably intertwined
      , any demarcation of the territory on the basis of pure identity is quasiimpossible.
      Violence and sovereignty, in this case, claim a divine foundation:
      peoplehood itself is forged by the worship of one deity, and national identity is
      imagined as an identity against the Other, other deities.53 History, geography, cartography
     , and archaeology are supposed to back these claims, thereby closely
      binding identity and topography. As a consequence, colonial violence and occupation
      are profoundly underwritten by the sacred terror of truth and exclusivity
      (mass expulsions, resettlement of “stateless” people in refugee camps, settlement
      of new colonies). Lying beneath the terror of the sacred is the constant excavation
      of missing bones; the permanent remembrance of a torn body hewn in a
      thousand pieces and never self-same; the limits, or better, the impossibility of
      representing for oneself an “original crime,” an unspeakable death: the terror of
      the Holocaust.54
         To return to Fanon’s spatial reading of colonial occupation, the late-modern
      colonial occupation in Gaza and the West Bank presents three major characteristics
      in relation to the working of the speci c terror formation I have called
      necropower. First is the dynamics of territorial fragmentation, the sealing off and

                      movement impossible and to implement separation along the model of the
                              apartheid state. The occupied territories are therefore divided into a web of intricate
                             internal borders and various isolated cells. According to Eyal Weizman, by
                              departing from a planar division of a territory and embracing a principle of creation
                             of three-dimensional boundaries across sovereign bulks, this dispersal and
                             segmentation clearly rede nes the relationship between sovereignty and space.55
                                 For Weizman, these actions constitute “the politics of verticality.” The resultant
                              form of sovereignty might be called “vertical sovereignty.” Under a regime of
                             vertical sovereignty, colonial occupation operates through schemes of over- and
                             underpasses, a separation of the airspace from the ground. The ground itself is
                              divided between its crust and the subterrain. Colonial occupation is also dictated
                              by the very nature of the terrain and its topographicalvariations (hilltops and valleys
                            , mountains and bodies of water). Thus, high ground offers strategic assets
                              not found in the valleys (effectiveness of sight, self-protection, panoptic forti cation
                            that generates gazes to many different ends). Says Weizman: “Settlements
                              could be seen as urban optical devices for surveillance and the exercise of power.”
                             Under conditions of late-modern colonial occupation,surveillance is both inwardand
                           outward-oriented, the eye acting as weapon and vice versa. Instead of the
                             conclusive division between two nations across a boundary line, “the organization
                              of the West Bank’s particular terrain has created multiple separations, provisional
                             boundaries, which relate to each other through surveillance and control,”
                            according to Weizman. Under these circumstances, colonial occupation is not
                              only akin to control, surveillance, and separation, it is also tantamount to seclusion.
                              It is a splintering occupation, along the lines of the splintering urbanism
                             characteristic of late modernity (suburban enclaves or gated communities).56
                                 From an infrastructural point of view, a splintering form of colonial occupation
                              is characterized by a network of fast bypass roads, bridges, and tunnels that
                       weave over and under one another in an attempt at maintaining the Fanonian
                            “principle of reciprocal exclusivity.” According to Weizman, “the bypass roads
                           attempt to separate Israeli traf c networks from Palestinian ones, preferably
                            without allowing them ever to cross. They therefore emphasize the overlapping
                             of two separate geographies that inhabit the same landscape. At points where the
                              networks do cross, a makeshift separation is created. Most often, small dust roads

      Israeli vans and military vehicles rush between settlements.”57
         Under conditions of vertical sovereignty and splintering colonial occupation,
     communities are separated across a y-axis. This leads to a proliferation of the
      sites of violence. The battlegrounds are not located solely at the surface of the
      earth. The underground as well as the airspace are transformed into con ict
      zones. There is no continuity between the ground and the sky. Even the boundaries
      in airspace are divided between lower and upper layers. Everywhere, the
      symbolics of the top (who is on top) is reiterated. Occupation of the skies therefore
      acquires a critical importance, since most of the policing is done from the air.
      Various other technologiesare mobilized to this effect: sensors aboard unmanned
      air vehicles (UAVs), aerial reconnaissance jets, early warning Hawkeye planes,
      assault helicopters, an Earth-observation satellite, techniques of “hologrammatization.”
      Killing becomes precisely targeted.
         Such precision is combined with the tactics of medieval siege warfare adapted
      to the networked sprawl of urban refugee camps. An orchestrated and systematic
      sabotage of the enemy’s societal and urban infrastructure network complements
      the appropriation of land, water, and airspace resources. Critical to these techniques
      of disablingthe enemy is bulldozing: demolishing houses and cities; uprooting
      olive trees; riddling water tanks with bullets; bombing and jamming electronic
      communications; digging up roads; destroying electricity transformers;
      tearing up airport runways; disabling television and radio transmitters; smashing
      computers; ransacking cultural and politico-bureaucratic symbols of the proto-
      Palestinian state; looting medical equipment. In other words, infrastructuralwar-
      fare.58 While the Apache helicopter gunship is used to police the air and to kill
      from overhead, the armored bulldozer (the Caterpillar D-9) is used on the ground
      as a weapon of war and intimidation. In contrast to early-modern colonial occupation
      , these two weapons establish the superiority of high-tech tools of latemodern
      terror.59
         As the Palestinian case illustrates, late-modern colonial occupation is a concatenation
      of multiple powers: disciplinary, biopolitical, and necropolitical. The

      Public Culture            combination of the three allocates to the colonial power an absolute domination
                              over the inhabitants of the occupied territory. The state of siege is itself a military
                              institution. It allows a modality of killing that does not distinguish between the
                             external and the internal enemy. Entire populations are the target of the sovereign.
                             The besieged villages and towns are sealed off and cut off from the world.
                             Daily life is militarized. Freedom is given to local military commanders to use
                             their discretion as to when and whom to shoot. Movement between the territorial
                              cells requires formal permits. Local civil institutionsare systematicallydestroyed.
                              The besieged populationis deprived of their means of income. Invisible killing is
                             added to outright executions.

                         War Machines and Heteronomy
                             After having examined the workings of necropower under the conditions of latemodern
                             colonial occupation, I would like to turn now to contemporary wars. Contemporary
                           wars belong to a new moment and can hardly be understood through
                              earlier theories of “contractual violence” or typologies of “just” and “unjust”
                         wars or even Carl von Clausewitz’s instrumentalism.60 According to Zygmunt
                             Bauman, wars of the globalization era do not include the conquest, acquisition,
                              and takeover of a territory among their objectives. Ideally, they are hit-and-run
                              affairs.
                         The growing gap between high-tech and low-tech means of war has never
                             been as evident as in the Gulf War and the Kosovo campaign. In both cases, the
                             doctrine of “overwhelming or decisive force” was implemented to its full effect
                              thanks to a military-technological revolution that has multiplied the capacity for
                            destruction in unprecedented ways.61 Air war as it relates to altitude, ordnance,
                              visibility, and intelligence is here a case in point. During the Gulf War, the
                         combined use of smart bombs and bombs coated with depleted uranium (DU),
                              high-tech stand-off weapons, electronic sensors, laser-guided missiles, cluster and
                             asphyxiation bombs, stealth capabilities, unmanned aerial vehicles, and cyberintelligence
                              quickly crippled the enemy’s capabilities.
                                In Kosovo, the “degrading” of Serbian capabilities took the form of an infrastructural
                             war that targeted and destroyed bridges, railroads, highways, commu-

      treatment facilities. As can be surmised, the execution of such a military strategy,
     especially when combined with the imposition of sanctions, results in shutting
     down the enemy’s life-support system. The enduring damage to civilian life is
      particularly telling. For example, the destruction of the Pancevo petrochemical
      complex in the outskirts of Belgrade during the Kosovo campaign “left the vicinity
      so toxic with vinyl chloride, ammonia, mercury, naphtha and dioxin that pregnant
      women were directed to seek abortions, and all local women were advised to
      avoid pregnancy for two years.”62
         Wars of the globalizationera therefore aim to force the enemy into submission
      regardless of the immediate consequences,side effects, and “collateral damage” of
      the military actions. In this sense, contemporary wars are more reminiscent of the
      warfare strategy of the nomads than of the sedentary nations or the “conquer-andannex”
      territorial wars of modernity. In Bauman’s words: “They rest their superiority
      over the settled population on the speed of their own movement; their own
      ability to descend from nowhere without notice and vanish again without warning,
      their ability to travel light and not to bother with the kind of belongings which con-
       ne the mobility and the maneuvering potential of the sedentary people.”63
         This new moment is one of global mobility. An important feature of the age of
      global mobility is that military operations and the exercise of the right to kill are
      no longer the sole monopoly of states, and the “regular army” is no longer the
     unique modality of carrying out these functions. The claim to ultimate or  nal
      authority in a particular political space is not easily made. Instead, a patchwork of
      overlapping and incomplete rights to rule emerges, inextricably superimposed and
      tangled, in which different de facto juridical instances are geographicallyinterwoven
      and plural allegiances, asymmetrical suzerainties, and enclaves abound.64 In

      Public Culture            this heteronymous organizationof territorial rights and claims, it makes little sense
                              to insist on distinctions between “internal” and “external” political realms, separated
                             by clearly demarcated boundaries.
                                 Let’s take Africa as an example. Here, the political economy of statehood dramatically
                             changed over the last quarter of the twentieth century. Many African
                             states can no longer claim a monopoly on violence and on the means of coercion
                             within their territory. Nor can they claim a monopoly on territorial boundaries.
                            Coercion itself has become a market commodity. Military manpower is bought
                        and sold on a market in which the identity of suppliers and purchasers means
                              almost nothing. Urban militias, private armies, armies of regional lords, private
                              security  rms, and state armies all claim the right to exercise violence or to kill.
                           Neighboring states or rebel movements lease armies to poor states. Nonstate
                              deployers of violence supply two critical coercive resources: labor and minerals.
                              Increasingly, the vast majority of armies are composed of citizen soldiers, child
                              soldiers, mercenaries, and privateers.65
                               Alongside armies have therefore emerged what, following Deleuze and Guattari
                             , we could refer to as war machines.66 War machines are made up of segments
                             of armed men that split up or merge with one another depending on the tasks to
                            be carried out and the circumstances. Polymorphous and diffuse organizations,
                             war machines are characterized by their capacity for metamorphosis. Their relation
                            to space is mobile. Sometimes, they enjoy complex links with state forms
                          (from autonomy to incorporation). The state may, of its own doing, transform
                             itself into a war machine. It may moreover appropriate to itself an existing war
                            machine or help to create one. War machines function by borrowing from regular
                              armies while incorporating new elements well adapted to the principle of segmentation
                              and deterritorialization. Regular armies, in turn, may readily appropriate
                             some of the characteristics of war machines.
                                 A war machine combines a plurality of functions. It has the features of a political
                              organization and a mercantile company. It operates through capture and
                              depredations and can even coin its own money. In order to fuel the extraction and

                              under a commission of war empowering the person to whom it is granted to carry on all forms of
                              hostility which are permissible at sea by the usages of war.” I use the term here to mean armed formations
                              acting independently of any politically organized society, in the pursuit of private interests,

      export of natural resources located in the territory they control, war machines            Necropolitics
      forge direct connections with transnational networks. War machines emerged in
      Africa during the last quarter of the twentieth century in direct relation to the erosion
      of the postcolonial state’s capacity to build the economic underpinnings of
      political authority and order. This capacity involves raising revenue and commanding
      and regulating access to natural resources within a well-de ned territory.
      In the mid-1970s, as the state’s ability to maintain this capacity began to
      erode, there emerged a clear-cut link between monetary instability and spatial
      fragmentation. In the 1980s, the brutal experience of money suddenly losing its
     value became more commonplace, with various countries undergoing cycles of
      hyperin ation (which included such stunts as the sudden replacement of a currency
      ). During the last decades of the twentieth century, monetary circulation has
      in uenced state and society in at least two different ways.
         First, we have seen a general drying-up of liquidities and their gradual concentration
      along certain channels, access to which has been subject to increasingly
      draconian conditions. As a result, the number of individuals endowed with
     the material means to control dependents through the creation of debts has
      abruptly decreased. Historically, capturing and  xing dependents through the
     mechanism of debt has always been a central aspect of both the production of
      people and the constitution of the political bond.67 Such bonds were crucial in
      determining the value of persons and gauging their value and utility. When their
      value and utility were not proven, they could be disposed of as slaves, pawns, or
      clients.
        Second, the controlled in ow and the  xing of movements of money around
      zones in which speci c resources are extracted has made possible the formation
      of enclave economies and has shifted the old calculus between people and things.
      The concentrationof activities connected with the extraction of valuable resources
      around these enclaves has, in return, turned the enclaves into privileged spaces of
     war and death. War itself is fed by increased sales of the products extracted.68
     New linkages have therefore emerged between war making, war machines, and
      resource extraction.69 War machines are implicated in the constitution of highly

      Public Culture            transnational local or regional economies. In most places, the collapse of formal
                              political institutions under the strain of violence tends to lead to the formation of
                              militia economies. War machines (in this case militias or rebel movements) rapidly
                             become highly organized mechanisms of predation, taxing the territories and the
                            population they occupy and drawing on a range of transnational networks and
                              diasporas that provide both material and  nancial support.
                                Correlated to the new geography of resource extraction is the emergence of an
                          unprecedented form of governmentality that consists in the management of the
                             multitudes. The extraction and looting of natural resources by war machines goes
                       hand in hand with brutal attempts to immobilize and spatially  x whole categories
                              of people or, paradoxically, to unleash them, to force them to scatter over
                              broad areas no longer containedby the boundaries of a territorial state. As a political
                              category, populations are then disaggregated into rebels, child soldiers, victims
                              or refugees, or civilians incapacitated by mutilation or simply massacred on
                              the model of ancient sacri ces, while the “survivors,” after a horri c exodus, are
                             con ned in camps and zones of exception.70
                               This form of governmentality is different from the colonial commandement.71
                             The techniques of policing and discipline and the choice between obedience and
                             simulation that characterized the colonial and postcolonial potentate are gradually
                             being replaced by an alternative that is more tragic because more extreme.
                             Technologies of destruction have become more tactile, more anatomical and sensorial
                              , in a context in which the choice is between life and death.72 If power still
                             depends on tight control over bodies (or on concentrating them in camps), the
                             new technologies of destruction are less concerned with inscribing bodies within
                             disciplinary apparatuses as inscribing them, when the time comes, within the
                            order of the maximal economy now represented by the “massacre.” In turn, the
                             generalization of insecurity has deepened the societal distinction between those
                           who bear weapons and those who do not ( loi de repartition des armes). Increas-

      ingly, war is no longer waged between armies of two sovereign states. It is waged             Necropolitics
      by armed groups acting behind the mask of the state against armed groups that
      have no state but control very distinct territories; both sides having as their main
      targets civilian populations that are unarmed or organized into militias. In cases
      where armed dissidents have not completely taken over state power, they have
      provoked territorial partitions and succeeded in controlling entire regions that
     they administer on the model of  efdoms, especially where there are mineral
      deposits.73
         The ways of killing do not themselves vary much. In the case of massacres in
      particular, lifeless bodies are quickly reduced to the status of simple skeletons.
      Their morphology henceforth inscribes them in the register of undifferentiated
      generality: simple relics of an unburied pain, empty, meaningless corporealities,
     strange deposits plunged into cruel stupor. In the case of the Rwandan genocide
      —in which a number of skeletons were at least preserved in a visible state,
      if not exhumed—what is striking is the tension between the petri cation of the
      bones and their strange coolness on one hand, and on the other, their stubborn
      will to mean, to signify something.
         In these impassive bits of bone, there seems to be no ataraxia: nothing but the
      illusory rejection of a death that has already occurred. In other cases, in which
      physical amputation replaces immediate death, cutting off limbs opens the way to
     the deployment of techniques of incision, ablation, and excision that also have
      bones as their target. The traces of this demiurgic surgery persist for a long time,
      in the form of human shapes that are alive, to be sure, but whose bodily integrity
      has been replaced by pieces, fragments, folds, even immense wounds that are dif-
       cult to close. Their function is to keep before the eyes of the victim—and of the
      people around him or her—the morbid spectacle of severing.

     Of Motion and Metal
     Let us return to the example of Palestine where two apparently irreconcilable
      logics are confronting each other: the logic of martyrdom and the logic of sur-
      vival. In examining these two logics, I would like to re ect on the twin issues of
      death and terror on the one hand and terror and freedom on the other.
         In the confrontation between these two logics, terror is not on one side and

         73. See Tony Hodges, Angola: From Afro-Stalinism to Petro-Diamond Capitalism (Oxford: James
      Currey, 2001), chap. 7; Stephen Ellis, The Mask of Anarchy: The Destruction of Liberia and the Reli-

      Public Culture            death on the other. Terror and death are at the heart of each. As Elias Canetti
                              reminds us, the survivor is the one who, having stood in the path of death, knowing
                              of many deaths and standing in the midst of the fallen, is still alive. Or, more
                             precisely, the survivor is the one who has taken on a whole pack of enemies and
                              managed not only to escape alive, but to kill his or her attackers. This is why, to a
                              large extent, the lowest form of survival is killing. Canetti points out that in the
                              logic of survival, “each man is the enemy of every other.” Even more radically, in
                              the logic of survival one’s horror at the sight of death turns into satisfaction that
                              it is someone else who is dead. It is the death of the other, his or her physical presence
                           as a corpse, that makes the survivor feel unique. And each enemy killed
                             makes the survivor feel more secure.74
                                 The logic of martyrdom proceeds along different lines. It is epitomized by the
                              gure of the “suicide bomber,” which itself raises a number of questions. What
                              intrinsic difference is there between killing with a missile helicopter or a tank and
                              killing with one’s own body? Does the distinctionbetween the arms used to in ict
                          death prevent the establishment of a system of general exchange between the
                            manner of killing and the manner of dying?
                         The “suicide bomber” wears no ordinary soldier’s uniform and displays no
                              weapon. The candidate for martyrdom chases his or her targets; the enemy is a prey
                              for whom a trap is set. Signi cant in this respect is the location of the ambush
                              laid: the bus stop, the café, the discotheque, the marketplace, the checkpoint, the
                             road—in sum, the spaces of everyday life.
                               The trapping of the body is added to the ambush location. The candidate for
                        martyrdom transforms his or her body into a mask that hides the soon-to-bedetonated
                          weapon. Unlike the tank or the missile that is clearly visible, the
                              weapon carried in the shape of the body is invisible. Thus concealed, it forms part
                              of the body. It is so intimately part of the body that at the time of detonation it
                              annihilates the body of its bearer, who carries with it the bodies of others when it
                             does not reduce them to pieces. The body does not simply conceal a weapon. The
                             body is transformed into a weapon, not in a metaphorical sense but in the truly
                              ballistic sense.
                               In this instance, my death goes hand in hand with the death of the Other.
                            Homicide and suicide are accomplished in the same act. And to a large extent,
                              resistance and self-destruction are synonymous. To deal out death is therefore to
                              reduce the other and oneself to the status of pieces of inert  esh, scattered every-

      where, and assembled with dif culty before the burial. In this case, war is the war             Necropolitics
      of body on body ( guerre au corps-à-corps). To kill, one has to come as close as
      possible to the body of the enemy. To detonate the bomb necessitates resolving
      the question of distance, through the work of proximity and concealment.
      How are we to interpret this manner of spilling blood in which death is not
      simply that which is my own, but always goes hand in hand with the death of the
      other?75 How does it differ from death in icted by a tank or a missile, in a context
      in which the cost of my survival is calculated in terms of my capacity and readiness
      to kill someone else? In the logic of “martyrdom,” the will to die is fused
      with the willingness to take the enemy with you, that is, with closing the door on
     the possibility of life for everyone. This logic seems contrary to another one,
      which consists in wishing to impose death on others while preserving one’s own
      life. Canetti describes this moment of survival as a moment of power. In such a
      case, triumph develops precisely from the possibility of being there when
      the others (in this case the enemy) are no longer there. Such is the logic of heroism
      as classically understood: to execute others while holding one’s own death at
      a distance.
         In the logic of martyrdom, a new semiosis of killing emerges. It is not necessarily
      based on a relationship between form and matter. As I have already indicated
     , the body here becomes the very uniform of the martyr. But the body as
      such is not only an object to protect against danger and death. The body in itself
     has neither power nor value. The power and value of the body result from a
      process of abstraction based on the desire for eternity. In that sense, the martyr,
     having established a moment of supremacy in which the subject overcomes his
    own mortality, can be seen as laboring under the sign of the future. In other
      words, in death the future is collapsed into the present.
         In its desire for eternity, the besieged body passes through two stages. First, it
      is transformed into a mere thing, malleable matter. Second, the manner in which
      it is put to death— suicide— affords it its ultimate signi cation. The matter of the
      body, or again the matter which is the body, is invested with properties that cannot
      be deduced from its character as a thing, but from a transcendentalnomos outside
      it. The besieged body becomes a piece of metal whose function is, through
      sacri ce, to bring eternal life into being. The body duplicates itself and, in death,
      literally and metaphorically escapes the state of siege and occupation.
         Let me explore, in conclusion, the relation between terror, freedom, and sacri
       ce. Martin Heidegger argues that the human’s “being toward death” is the deci-

                                                                                  37

      Public Culture            sive condition of all true human freedom.76 In other words, one is free to live
                             one’s own life only because one is free to die one’s own death. Whereas Heidegger
                              grants an existential status to being-toward-death and considers it an event of
                              freedom, Bataille suggests that “sacri ce in reality reveals nothing.” It is not simply
                           the absolute manifestation of negativity. It is also a comedy. For Bataille,
                              death reveals the human subject’s animal side, which he refers to moreover as the
                              subject’s “natural being.” “For man to reveal himself in the end, he has to die, but
                        he will have to do so while alive—by looking at himself ceasing to exist,” he
                             adds. In other words, the human subject has to be fully alive at the very moment
                              of dying, to be aware of his or her death, to live with the impression of actually
                              dying. Death itself must become awareness of the self at the very time that it does
                              away with the conscious being. “In a sense, this is what happens (what at least is
                              on the point of taking place, or what takes place in an elusive, fugitive manner),
                              by means of a subterfuge in the sacri ce. In the sacri ce, the sacri ced identi es
                             himself with the animal on the point of death. Thus he dies seeing himself die,
                             and even, in some sense, through his own will, at one with the weapon of sacri-
                               ce. But this is play!” And for Bataille, play is more or less the means by which
                              the human subject “voluntarily tricks himself.”77
                    How does the notion of play and trickery relate to the “suicide bomber”?
                              There is no doubt that in the case of the suicide bomber the sacri ce consists of
                              the spectacular putting to death of the self, of becoming his or her own victim
                              (self-sacri ce). The self-sacri ced proceeds to take power over his or her death
                             and to approach it head-on. This power may be derived from the belief that the
                              destruction of one’s own body does not affect the continuityof the being. The idea
                              is that the being exists outside us. The self-sacri ce consists, here, in the removal
                            of a twofold prohibition: that of self-immolation (suicide) and that of murder.
                              Unlike primitive sacri ces, however, there is no animal to serve as a substitute
                              victim. Death here achieves the character of a transgression. But unlike cruci xion
                              , it has no expiatory dimension. It is not related to the Hegelian paradigms of
                              prestige or recognition. Indeed, a dead person cannot recognize his or her killer,
                              who is also dead. Does this imply that death occurs here as pure annihilation and
                            nothingness, excess and scandal?
                                Whether read from the perspective of slavery or of colonial occupation, death
                         and freedom are irrevocably interwoven. As we have seen, terror is a de ning
                             feature of both slave and late-modern colonial regimes. Both regimes are also

      speci c instances and experiences of unfreedom. To live under late modern occu-             Necropolitics
      pation is to experience a permanent condition of “being in pain”: forti ed structures
      , military posts, and roadblocks everywhere; buildingsthat bring back painful
     memories of humiliation, interrogations, and beatings; curfews that imprison
     hundreds of thousands in their cramped homes every night from dusk to daybreak
      ; soldiers patrolling the unlit streets, frightened by their own shadows; children
      blinded by rubber bullets; parents shamed and beaten in front of their families
      ; soldiers urinating on fences, shooting at the rooftop water tanks just for fun,
      chanting loud offensive slogans, pounding on fragile tin doors to frighten the children
      , con scating papers, or dumping garbage in the middle of a residential neighborhood
      ;border guards kickingover a vegetable stand or closing borders at whim;
      bones broken; shootings and fatalities—a certain kind of madness.78
        In such circumstances, the discipline of life and the necessities of hardship
      (trial by death) are marked by excess. What connects terror, death, and freedom
      is an ecstatic notion of temporality and politics. The future, here, can be authentically
      anticipated, but not in the present. The present itself is but a moment of
      vision—vision of the freedom not yet come. Death in the present is the mediator
      of redemption. Far from being an encounter with a limit, boundary,or barrier, it is
      experienced as “a release from terror and bondage.”79 As Gilroy notes, this preference
      for death over continued servitude is a commentary on the nature of freedom
      itself (or the lack thereof). If this lack is the very nature of what it means for
     the slave or the colonized to exist, the same lack is also precisely the way in
      which he or she takes account of his or her mortality. Referring to the practice of
      individual or mass suicide by slaves cornered by the slave catchers, Gilroy suggests
      that death, in this case, can be represented as agency. For death is precisely
      that from and over which I have power. But it is also that space where freedom
      and negation operate.

      Conclusion
      In this essay I have argued that contemporary forms of subjugation of life to the
      power of death (necropolitics) profoundly recon gure the relations among resistance
      , sacri ce, and terror. I have demonstrated that the notion of biopower is
      insuf cient to account for contemporary forms of subjugation of life to the power

                        to account for the various ways in which, in our contemporary world,
                             weapons are deployed in the interest of maximum destruction of persons and the
                             creation of death-worlds, new and unique forms of social existence in which vast
                              populations are subjected to conditions of life conferring upon them the status of
                             living dead. The essay has also outlined some of the repressed topographies of
                              cruelty (the plantation and the colony in particular) and has suggested that under
                              conditions of necropower, the lines between resistance and suicide, sacri ce and
                           redemption, martyrdom and freedom are blurred.
